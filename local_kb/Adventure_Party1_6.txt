Soft And Crunchy
Players and GMs; the fundamental ingredients needed for even a remotely ‘traditional’ RPG. That can be said another way to apply to an even older tradition, the very source of Role Playing itself, the Audience and the Story Teller. The charts and the dice, the rules and the rolls, they are but the trappings we dress it with when we call it a Role Playing Game. But, at its core, under all the crunchy bits, there is the Audience and the Story Teller. It is this core of story telling and not the trappings that Adventure Party focuses on and involves in every phase of the game as a key ingredient. 


This is not to say Adventure Party doesn’t have those crunchier systems, as it does, but they are separated out into an optional layer of ‘Crunchy Rules’ from the required ’Soft Rules’ that are the foundation of the Adventure Party RP Engine. Both are found within this book, with the Crunchy Rules identified as such using the               label and generally located in the right side bar near the relevant Soft Rules which makes the main body of this book. Some Crunchy Rules, while still optional, often have a significant positive impact on Role Playing, and it is suggested they be used even if no other Crunchy Rules are, these are indicated by  


The Soft Rules are the foundation of the Role Play Engine and are designed for fast, story driven gameplay where numbers and dice rolls are used sparingly and only in support of role playing.  The Crunchy Rules use the Soft Rules as a foundation to build a far more ‘crunchy’ rules set for those players and GM’s that want more detailed rules, more randomized characters, and a significant increase in the amount of numbers and dice rolling during game play. While the story is the main foundation for both Soft and Crunchy Rules, those players and GMs who want more fast action Role Play might find that the Soft Rules serve them better. Those who are in for the long haul and enjoy 'roll play' with their Role Playing might find the Crunchy Rules to be the better experience


 This is not to mean the story becomes less of the play focus when using Crunchy Rules; since the Soft Rules are the foundation the story will always be central to game play but It can slow the play speed down which may impede fast attempt Role Playing. ( I don’t like the last sentence, suggestions?)


In order for the players and the GM to create any story that they want, the Adventure Party Game Engine is designed as a universal system with both the Soft and Crunchy rules usable for any genre of game play. In addition there are many example rules for a number of genre specific options such, as magic, super powers, psionic, etc. 






Character Generation
Power Level (PL)
Power Level  is an indication of just that, how powerful a character is and to some degree has the potential of becoming relative to the rest of the characters in the world. Most  ‘Common Folk’ have a PL of Mundane. There is nothing particularly special about them or much that distinguishes them above the rest of the masses; they most likely will never be much more ‘powerful’ than they started as.


 A PL of Tough means the character is generally ‘Better’ at things than most people and is the suggested starting PL for player characters, think of these as star athletes, elite  soldiers, master craftsmen and so on. This progression of ‘better’ continues with each step of PL, with Mighty being the highest suggested PL, anything beyond that would start moving into the divine, godlike or cosmic being territory. PL will determine the number of character points available for purchasing Skills and Aspects, Skill and Aspect Caps, Story Point Refresh and so on.  PL is usually determined by the GM though they can certainly accept input from the players to allow them to have some influence over how powerful their characters are.

Story Points (SP) & Refresh (RFR)
Story Points are the most important resources available to a player in Adventure Party as they are your most powerful tool to directly influence the story in ways that they desire. They can spend SP at almost any point in the game to do a wide variety of things depending on the situation and the current point in The Story. 


Characters get their Refresh value of their Power Level in story points at the start of character generation and at the start of every game session plus any SP left over from the last game session for an existing character.

Introduction to Gen-Play


In the Adventure Party RPG system, Gen-Play (Character Generation Play) is a dynamic and collaborative approach to character creation. It transforms the process of character development into an engaging and interactive storytelling experience, deeply rooted in the game's narrative.
* Each player who is creating a new character then rolls 1d6 to determine the order the GM will pick players to detail a trait (chosen by the GM) for their character out loud to the GM and the rest of the players.  
* If a player wants to keep the details of Trait secret from other players they can spend 4 SP to keep it hidden. Other players  can spend 2 SP to 'pry' and learn the details of the secret Trait. 
* Players can also spend SP to affect the trait in opened ended ways; the GM determining if it is permitted and SP cost as well as possible additional repercussion to both characters depending on the Trait and nature of the change. 
* If the player ’links’ one trait into another in such a way as to foster Character Story and the GM agrees, they receive 1 SP. 
* If the players make a valid (per GM) link to a trait of another character they get 2 SP. Any time a player attempts to link to or alter another playerss Trait, and the target player doesn’t agree, it becomes an Opposed Attempt between the two players with only SP available to adjust rolls (see Opposed Actions rules).
Gen-Play is not just about creating characters; it's about crafting the foundation of the game's narrative. It sets the stage for future adventures and ensures that characters are not only well-defined but also deeply integrated into the story and with each other. This process enhances player engagement and investment in both their characters and the overall campaign.


Gen-Play Example
GM: Ok, characters are Tough Power Lever so they all start with 6 Story Points, everybody roll 1d6 for play order.
Players Roll, after hashing out the play order based on highest roll first to lowest roll last the play continues. 
GM: (to 1st player) Ok, what’s your characters’ Origin Story concept and name. 
Player1: (rolled 6) My character is Corg Orswin of Gal’Da, he’s from a sea faring family, maybe like a Viking or something but not real big and mean. Maybe like a priest or something.
GM: Ok, nothing to role play there yet, they’ll have to flush that out more. Next! (She points at the second player)
Player2: (rolled 4) I’m making Kaldra Flurn ’Spark Hand’ , she’s a Goblin and escaped from this evil wizards layer with her family when she was a kid. They got caught in this lightning trap when they were escaping, everyone in her family was killed except her. She lived because the magical experiments the evil wizard did on her, they “changed” her so instead of the lightning killing her it gave her super powers. And she’s not quite ‘right’, not even for a Goblin.
GM: OH K!  Cool back story, explains her epithet, but we’ll have to role play that  a bit. We’ll see how unscathed she actually was coming out of there. And maybe who’s still hunting her.
Player4: Ooohhh.. I want to jump in her story!
GM: Since it’s not your turn it will cost you at least 1 Story Point.
Player4: yep, no problem. I want to be the one looking for Spark Hand.
Player2: Hey!!
GM: That could complicate the story, but could also really add to it, I’ll allow it, but it will cost you, do you work for the wizard?
Player4: No. I want to kill the wizard and I heard a Goblin named Spark Hand knows how to get to him.
Player2: Yes!
GM: Ok, I like that, we’ll cover why on your turn but since that won’t complicate my job, like having you after her would,  it won’t cost you as many Story Points. In fact that’s a link to her Name Aspect so you get 1 Story Point (indicating Player 4). Ok, your turn. (Points to Player3 while player 4 records the earned point on their character sheet)
Player3: I’m going to play Rin Geffers ‘Extraordinaire’, he’s a shape changer and actor slash con-man, he can change his face at will and maybe grow extra appendages.  He’s from a planet that orbits around a star that emits an energy that also gives him innate magic abilities, like mind tricks and illusions. 
 GM: Ok, that shape changing could get expensive, it will need an origin story too and maybe some role play but I’ll allow it. No problem with the innate magic but it sounds more like Psionic to me. We’ll see about the other planet, have to see how that fits into the campaign.
Player3: Sure, no problem. I like the Psionic idea, think I’ll go with that and I suppose I could just be an ‘alien’ or exotic species. 
Player2: Or one of the Evil Wizards experiments!
Player3: Eh, I don’t know if I want that.
Player2: I do! It will fit perfect with my story, friend or enemy, either way works for me!
Player3: Hey, you weren’t for it when you thought HE (poking player 4) was going to be an enemy!
Player2: (Laughing) Yeh, that’s him! You are gonna roll!!
GM:OK, It will cost you (indicating Player2) 1 Story Point to Force her story and it’s an Opposed Attempt so you two have to roll off.
Player2 nods and subtracts the one point from her total.
GM: Ok, anyone spending Story Points to add rolls?
Player2: I’ll spend 2 Story Points. (marks points off)
GM: Wow, that’s a lot, you sure?
Player2: Yep.
Player3:Nope, not spending any, not that important, let her spend the points.
Both players roll 1d100
Player2 rolls 3 times, her normal roll plus 1 roll per Story Point spent, and takes the highest which is 78.
Player3 rolls 1 time but rolls a 97, which is higher than 94 for it’s an Open Ended Up roll so she gets to roll again and add the two rolls. The second roll is a 50 so she has a 147.
GM:OOOOOH!! Ok, not only do they not get to Force his story, he gets a free Force on YOUR story!
Player3: HA HA!! Ohhh this will be good, what can I do? (rubbing hands together)
Player2:Remember we’re in the same party!
Player3:Ya ha.
GM: With that roll, Hmmm, I’ll let you decide if the Wizard really did send someone to hunt her.
Player3: Yeh! Cool! So he did send someone, someone that I know and I need to find.
Player2: Need to find? Like they are your friend? So are we enemies? I mean I don’t care either way like I said, good story, just wondering.
Player3: No, not enemies, but your character won’t know that, I’m not sure why I have to find him but I have to.
GM: Ok, they can cover that when we detail the name elements. For now let's move on. (looks to player4) Who are they playing.
Player4: I’m going to play Vincent Jacob Blackburn, aka The Seeker, a human Spell Slinger that ‘seeks’ the wizard who killed his father. He is a cross between a wizard and a gun fighter, he can cast spells by hand but usually uses magic items to ’fast cast’ his opponents to death. He has a Focused personality which drives him on his relentless and ruthless quest to find and kill the man who slew his father. He  is so completely obsessed with his quest that people have come to know him simply as The Seeker because he’s always saying to people ‘I seek the wizard who killed my father, when I find him I will say to  him “You  killed my father, prepare to die!”.
GM:OK, Detailed, I like it! That works for sure and since I can see all sorts of ways I can use that story to enhance the over all one and tie the other characters in with it I’ll give they 2 Story Points.


Character Story
The Character Story in AP RPG starts as an initial concept that evolves throughout gameplay. It begins with the character creation phase, where players come up with a basic idea about their character, including their background, current situation, and future goals. This story is intentionally vague at the start, allowing it to be shaped and refined based on the character's development through aspects, stats, and other choices made during character generation. It not only guides the player in creating a cohesive character but also provides a narrative foundation for the GM and other players to build upon in their character and world development. As the game progresses, the Character Story adapts and grows with the character, reflecting their experiences, choices, and the evolving narrative of the game.
Aspects
The most important concept in the game's mechanics, Aspects are anything that describes a character (or anything else for that matter) that is not a learned skill. This includes, but is not limited to, things such as attributes, innate abilities, skill aptitudes, inherited gifts, Fears, Personality Types, supernormal powers, and so on.  Aspects are broken into 3 groups, Personal (PS) , Universal (UA) , and Special (SA)  which are further broken down into categories within the groups and then into the individual Aspects. 


Generally all Aspects can be adjusted by spending Character Points to do so, which a player gets at the start of character development or are awarded by the GM; usually during or after a game session. Most Aspects are measured in Ranks using the Rank ladder, though some, especially Personalities and Traits may have no corresponding Rank at all, while others may have an ‘effective’ rank only in certain situations depending on the GM’s needs.


 Aspect Ranks
Eleven adjectives with corresponding bonus and difficulty values are used to measure an Aspect, this is called the Aspect Rank . These eleven ranks allow them to quickly grasp how far from or close to the ‘average’ a Aspect is, such as how much stronger/weaker, faster/slower, richer/poorer, etc.  a character is from an ‘average’ person in their world. Ranks are also used as a measure of a character’s ability at a given skill, the higher/lower the rank the better/worse they are at a given skill.

 For example a bodyguard might be a Good swordsman but have Mediocre social skills. He’ll probably win a fight with an artist who’s a Superb painter but a Poor swordsman. Almost anything can be described using this ladder; an empire may field a Superb army, or a spaceship may be limping by with a Poor engine.
Universal Aspects (UA)
Aspects that everyone in the game world has to some degree. Characters are considered to have all Aspects at an Average rank unless modified during character creation, game play, or character advancement and only adjusted Aspects are recorded on the character sheet. 


Universal Aspects fall into either Attribute Aspects which describe a character's physical, mental or mystical Aspects of Life Aspects which describe key Aspects of their Character Concept and Origin and are often related to Personal Situations.




Purchasing Universal Aspects
Universal Aspects (UA) are ‘purchased’ by spending Character Points (CP); each point spent raises the Aspect by one Rank. A player can also lower a rank of a UA and  gain 1 CP per rank lowered; the gained points can then be used to raise the rank of a different or multiple Aspects. 


The amount of CP a player starts with depends on the power level of the character; for example, a Mundane character starts with 1 CP while a Valiant character starts with 5 CP, as shown in the chart above. No Aspects Rank can be lowered below the power level’s Floor or be raised higher than the Cap. Finally, the number of Aspects higher or lower than Average, combined, can not be more than the Max Aspects. So a mundane character can not have more than 4 Aspects higher OR lower than Average.


A universal Aspects rank can be raised by spending CP on them and lowered below Average to gain CP back that they can then use to raise the rank of a different universal Aspect. The base number of CP a player has available to them during Character Development  is determined by the power level of the character. A character can not start the game with any universal Aspect lower than their power levels Universal Aspect Floor (UA FLR) or higher than the cap (UA CAP) nor can they adjust more than their maximum number of universal Aspects (Max # UA).

Attribute Aspects
Physical Attributes
Strength (STR)
Physical power, influence the amount of damage the character can do  with a physical attack, how quickly they can swing a weapon, the amount of weight it can carry and so on. 


Constitution (CON)
 physical endurance influences the amount of damage that the character can sustain from a physical attack, its ability to resist poisons & disease, endure exposure to the elements and so on.


Dexterity (DEX)
 physical speed and agility, influences your character's attack accuracy, the speed at which it can attack, ability to avoid traps, dodge physical  and some magical attacks and so on. 


Mental Attributes
Intelligence (INT)
ability to learn, comprehend and process knowledge, influences a wide range of academic and scholarly skills, adeptness at employing certain types of magic, degree of Psi powers, ability to ‘figure things out’ and so on.


Bearing (BER)
 personal strength of character, willpower and drive, influences ability to socially interact, resist mind control and attacks,  control magical forces,  use Psi powers, general ‘mental strength’ checks and so on.


Perception (PER)
 a measure of  spatial awareness and alertness, influences attack accuracy, the ability to find  hidden items,  notice small details, track fast moving objects, combat initiative and so on. 


Mystical Attributes
Evocation (EVO)
a measure of the amount of spiritual and magical energy a character can muster to cast spells and manipulate the powers of magic and mysticism. Influences charging and maintain magical effects and spells, creating magical items, defending against magical and spiritual attacks and any other attempt requiring the expenditure of magical energy.


Luck (LUK)
 a measure of what ‘side’ of totally random events a character tends to end up on such as games of chance, finding success/failure when ’the odds are against they’ and so on. 


Attunement (ATN)
a measure of connection with ’The Powers That Be’ such as Gods, Demons, Angels, spirits, etc. and how aware those beings are of a character. A lower than Average attunement makes it  difficult getting their attention and hard to strike bargains or have prayers  acknowledged and granted. An attunement of Terrible or lower can make a character so below the notice of said beings a character is all but invisible to them and would never be noticed short of direct confrontation. The opposite applies to a higher than Average attunement, as without taking any attempt to gain notice or attention a character may be included in a being’s ‘plans’ for good or ill.




Talent Dice 
Attribute Aspects add a number of “Talent” Dice to a player’s Attempt Role if the GM determines it would be a source attribute for any Talent (or non-Talent) the character would have in whatever they are attempting in the given situation.


 For each rank above or below Average the character’s Attribute is, they add a dice to their roll. The type of dice (d4,d6,d10,etc.) is left to the GM to decide based on how relevant the attribute is but a d4 is a good lowest default.  If the Attribute is higher than Average, the character is considered to be Talented in the attempt and the Talent Roll is added to their Attempt Roll. 


The opposite is true if it is below Average; the character is considered un-Talented and their Talent Roll is subtracted from their Attempt Roll.  When an Attribute is relevant depends on the situation and is left to the GM to decide, but for example, Strength might be relevant when the character is trying to lift a heavy gate or break down a door but not relevant when trying to notice a hidden item. 














Life Aspects
 Life Aspects should be a major consideration with regards to the players’ Character Concept as they often are directly rooted in and derived from a character’s family, race,  past history, chosen vocation and so on. 


Station
A measure of a character’s social status in the society in which they live, influences how other characters act towards them, such as in looking ’up’ or ’down’ on them, their access to influential people, special locations and events, how much ’authority’ they have in their social circle and the size of the social circle itself and so on. An important thing to keep in mind about Station is that a character’s Station has to be recognized by other characters for it to have any effect. An Average Station is considered to be an  ‘every day’ citizen with no special privileges or stigmas in the society in which they live. A lower then average means the character has some degree of stigma and higher than average means they have some influence and standing. Ranks lower than Poor and higher than Good indicate that the character’s Station would be recognized to some degree or another outside their ‘local’ society as their fame/infamy ‘follows’ them.




Means
A measure of the resources available to the character such as a source of income, favors owed, lands, businesses, equipment or anything else that generates or cost a tangible and possibly On-going ‘value’. The key words being ‘tangible value’ and ‘On-Going,’ so in general a player can not take a lower than average means and say that indicates they are starting with no equipment and have that be the only effect of the low means. They could say they are starting with no equipment because they had to sell everything they had to pay on a gambling debt to a powerful loan shark that will hunt them down and physically injure them if they don’t pay them back in a certain amount of time.  If the rank is Terrible or lower in addition to having the ‘tangible value’ requirement, the On-going requirement needs to be satisfied as well so they should owe enough that they will have a very hard time paying the whole debt  off and thus they will have a revolving debt issue. A higher than Average Means does not have these requirements BUT a player can’t just say they are wealthy or rich, they have to be specific as to what makes them wealthy or rich. If they have a Means of Great or higher they have the option of saying their means is on-going and have to determine the specifics of that. 
Means may or may not be tied in with Station as a character with a high enough Station to be a  ‘Nobel’ may have a lower than Average Means due to debts owed.  The form of a player’s means can have a significant impact on The Story as well, such as a character choosing to have a store as their Means, which would tend to keep the story revolving around the store or at least the stores location. Before a player chooses a ‘stationary’ means like a store they should consult with the GM and their fellow players to make sure they all agree with the direction that would take the story. Means should also be within ‘the realm of reason’ and fit the world the characters live in, so a character that lives in a world without magic shouldn't have a magic sword as part of their Means. The GM is the ultimate decider on the nature of a character’s Means both in total value and On-Going benefit/determent. 




Worldliness
A measure of a character’s general knowledge and awareness of the world they inhabit, influences the amount of ‘useless facts,’ general trivia, knowledge of current affairs, grasp on common lore and ‘Pop culture’, familiarity with distant lands, cultures and concepts, and so on. 
A character with a lower than average Worldliness would be considered generally naïve or even ignorant, often easily taken advantage of or duped as they have very little grasp on ’how the world works.’ A character with a higher than average worldliness is considered to be somewhat sophisticated or wise and would be difficult to trick, being quicker to recognize a ‘bad situation’ and know when things just don’t ‘smell right.’ Worldliness does not give characters additional skills, augment their attributes, or give the character knowledge they couldn’t possibly know. However, it could allow them to use their skills and attributes in different and interesting way because they heard about this ‘trick.’ give them a reason to know something the player knows because they just happened to read this obscure book, article, etc. and so on. Worldliness may or may not be related to a character’s Station and Resources depending on the character concept and like everything else in Adventure Party, the GM has the ultimate decision on how worldliness is applied during game play and its influence on The Story. 


Life Aspects In Game Play 
Life Aspects are a bit less specific on their exact use than Attribute Aspects and have a heavy dependency on the situation and how the players and GM are applying them. Sometimes they will be used like Attribute Aspects, adjusting the number of Talent Dice being rolled, other times they will be used to bring about an effect or alter the direction of the story based on their rank without a roll.


 For example, when a player is trying to see if their character knows some obscure fact the GM might allow them to make a roll against the difficulty of the attempt using the Rank of their Worldliness, or allow them to add dice to a roll against a relevant skill such as Lore or History


. A different example would be when a character is trying to gain an audience with a noble or other authority figure by using their Station; if the character has a high enough Station the GM may decide they are well enough known and important enough no roll is required. Still another would be where a character is attempting to gain and audience but the GM requires an Opposed Attempt Roll against a  Doorman's BER; the GM may allow the player to add Talent Dice to the roll due to their Station.
Station: Noble Seeking Aid
* Scenario: A character of high Station (Noble) seeks aid from the local lord.
* Application: Due to their high Station, the character is immediately granted an audience without an Opposed Attempt Roll. Their noble status opens doors that would be closed to others.
Means: Wealthy Merchant's Negotiation
* Scenario: A wealthy merchant needs to secure a critical trade deal.
* Application: The merchant's Great Means allows them to sway negotiations, adding Talent Dice to their roll in a trade negotiation due to their reputation for wealth and reliability.
Worldliness: Adventurer's Insight
* Scenario: An adventurer with high Worldliness encounters an ancient artifact.
* Application: The character's Worldliness enables them to recall a relevant obscure fact about the artifact, aiding in its identification without needing a Lore or History roll.
Station: Disgraced Soldier's Struggle
* Scenario: A soldier with a low Station due to a past dishonor.
* Application: The soldier's low Station causes distrust among new acquaintances, possibly requiring additional Attempt Rolls in social interactions to gain trust.
Means: Impoverished Scholar's Challenge
* Scenario: A scholar with low Means struggles to access rare texts.
* Application: The scholar's lack of resources limits their access to important research materials, impacting the direction of their quest for knowledge.
Worldliness: Naive Farmer in the City
* Scenario: A farmer with low Worldliness visits a large city for the first time.
* Application: Their lack of worldliness might lead to them being easily duped or overcharged in the market, requiring vigilance and possibly additional rolls for mundane tasks.
Station: Renowned Healer's Influence
* Scenario: A healer with a high Station due to their healing abilities.
* Application: The healer's reputation precedes them, allowing them to gain trust and cooperation from patients and authorities without the need for persuasion rolls.
Means: Inventor with Resources
* Scenario: An inventor with substantial Means develops a new device.
* Application: Their Means provides the necessary materials and tools for invention, possibly avoiding rolls that would be required to gather or fund these resources.
Worldliness: Diplomat's Cultural Insight
* Scenario: A diplomat with high Worldliness engages in sensitive negotiations.
* Application: Their broad knowledge of cultures and customs allows them to navigate the negotiations smoothly, potentially adding Talent Dice to their Diplomacy rolls.
Station: Exiled Prince's Challenge
* Scenario: A prince who has been exiled and thus has a lowered Station.
* Application: The prince's reduced social status impacts their interactions, potentially requiring additional rolls to convince others of their identity and intentions, where their higher Station would have made this unnecessary.






















Personal Trait Aspects
All characters have traits that represent the building blocks of their personality and are the ’essence’ of who your character is and what she is about . Character Traits are treated as Aspects and can change through game play or by spending CP to alter them after Character Development; however, the Soft Rules do not require CP to be spent on them during character generation. There is no order in which they must detail your Traits, and it is common to start one before finishing another. Players can also change a portion or all of one to fit better with one they detail later or to fit a desired Personality.


When detailing your Traits keep in mind that all the Aspects they choose later in character development like Personality, Attributes, Life Aspects, Race, etc.  should have a direct tie back to a detail in at least one Trait. For this reason Traits can be freely changed at any time before the GM declares Character Development  is complete. In this way if the player decides they want to add or remove an Aspect that is not already supported by one of their Traits they are free to change the details of any trait to support the story for the new Aspect or removal of an existing one. 


Exactly what constitutes a  ‘supporting trait’ is left to the GM to decide but common sense rules should apply. For example, if the character has a Status Aspect giving him a military rank, it would make sense to have a trait that makes him pre-disposed to military life such as an Aspiration to be a soldier.


World View 
 How does the character look at the world based on everything they know or think they know, this is how the world looks to the character from the inside out, ie. do they see the glass as half full or half empty.


Fears 
 Unless the player takes an Aspect to specifically be fearless, all characters have at least one mundane fear that makes them ‘shiver at the thought’ and get the 'heebe geebees', etc. when faced with the object of their fear. Mundane Fears are not debilitating but they will make the character hesitate and 'think twice' before facing their fears and 'dealing with it' and most characters have a number of them. 


Style: 
 The typical state of the characters’ gear, clothing and over all physical appearance and how they appear to 'keep themselves'  to others. 


Demeanor 
The way the characters conducts themselves and how that observed behavior appears to the average outside observer.  


Aspirations :
What the characters hope they can achieve when the finally 'make it', the Big Pay Off, ie Their Life's Dream.


Goals 
The components that make up the characters’ 'life plan'  and the steps they see themselves needing to take in order to achieve their Aspirations. These are not tomorrow Goals but someday goals, for example a character aspires to a rule a country, so one goal might be to win a great contest to earn a title and get a shot at the crown.


Motivations
What keeps the character going day to day doing what they need to do to achieve their Goals and one day realize their Aspiration. For example it could be a religious faith or personal philosophy, a dependent they care about, revenge, etc.  


Inspiration
What inspires the character in their darkest hours and gives them hope that one day they can achieve their Aspirations. For example, a Mother who taught them to believe in themselves, They get their strength from their god and faith, believe that If they never give up they never loose, etc.
 








Personality Types 
All characters normally only have one Personality Type though certain Aspects, Traumas and game play events can change that. Every character gets one free Personality Type, the GM may also allow multiple character types for CP or other cost if they so choose. You should choose your Personality Type based on the details of your traits and what makes sense for your Character Story. For example it wouldn't make sense for a character who has no Aspiration or Goals to have a focused personality.  


Journeying 
A person who changes over time, usually as a result of resolving a central conflict or facing a major crisis.  When choosing Journeying, the player must choose a second ‘effective’ personality, which  is ‘who they are’  at the start of the game and will change through the character’s journey until they resolve their central conflict and ‘find themselves’ and their ‘true’ personality. 


Focused 
This personality is notable for having narrowly focused world views, Goals and Aspirations which generally results in highly compatible and symbiotic traits where most or all of them keep a consistent theme.  They tend to have a small set of Aspects, skills, and vocations that they concentrate on perfecting, often due to an underlying trait such as Fears, Goals, or Aspirations. They are fond of doing things ‘their way,’ and the personality type most likely to develop a Personal Technique as well as to be seen as ‘Fanatical’ by others.


Bedrock
A person who is seen as reliable, trustworthy, and dependable, the ‘Salt of the earth’. While they are not as ridged as Focused or as fanatical as Guardians, they do not transform or evolve much over time choosing to stick with their own tried and true way of doing things. They have low Mutability as a rule and  tend to like the idea of stability, something they  try to foster in their lives and the lives of those around them both by leading by example and trying to minimize the influence of those who foment instability. 


Conflicted
 A person with conflicted or contradictory traits. These types of characters often have  two or more traits that have details that conflict with each other, for example a character that has a world view of ‘wanting to save the world’ but has a fear of failure so never tries but ‘beats themselves up’ for not trying. 


Guardian
A person that see’s himself as a protector and defender of a group of people, religion, ideal, or other cause. They always see themselves as on the ‘right side’ of any conflict as long as they are staying true to their cause and go to great length to defend not only their cause but others who support it, especially those who are weaker or seen as ‘Icons of the Faith’.


Anti-Hero 
A personality that lacks conventional nobility of mind, and struggles for values not deemed universally admirable, but tends to find himself on the ‘Right Side’ of morals ‘in the end’. These types of personalities often walk in two worlds, having contacts both in the underworld as well as with law abiding citizens and often having personal, if not necessarily amiable, relationships with enforcers on both sides of the ‘law’.


Devil’s Advocate
A personality that is often seen as contradictory and antagonistic, Devil’s Advocates are fond of pointing out the ‘other side’ of the situation. They frequently find themselves in minor opposition with those who they are trying to get to ’see the other side’ and whose personality contrasts with their own such as Focused, Bedrock, and especially Guardian personalities.


Mentor
 A personality prone to taking the less experienced ‘under wing’ and showing them the ropes. Mentors often find their personal satisfaction  and fulfillment in assisting others in achieving their own Goals and Aspirations and are generally supportive of those around them. The can 


Minion
A personality who finds their own sense of drive, self worth or direction in following a leader or movement.  Minions tend to prefer ‘Group Think’ or Authoritarianism over thinking for themselves and often gravitate towards those who can provide that such as Mentors, Guardians and Focused personalities.


Survivor
A personality type their own survival (physical, mental and/or spiritual) is the singular goal, anything else that doesn’t support that central goal is secondary and considered optional. Survivors often take on a secondary personality in times of extended danger or stress that is their ‘true’ nature when their survival is at stake such as Focused or Guardian and centered on their own survival. Survivors 








 
Origin Story
Characters don’t just pop out of the air; they have a long history going back to the very moment they were born and their ancestors before them. 


In Adventure Party the Origin Story is what drives the character development. As players are developing their characters Origin Story they should keep in mind that a good Origin Story is specific enough to give a solid concept of the characters story but vague enough to allow abundant ’tie-ins’ for the Traits and Aspects detailed later in development. This allows for easier explanations of why the character has those particular Traits and Aspect and also affords more opportunity for the GM and other characters so interact with the Characters Story. 






Personal Situations
 Personal Situations don’t give the character any extra powers, items, abilities or other tangible things like Aspects, instead, they give those Aspects ’flavor’ or meaning. They are rooted in an Aspects, arising as a consequence of having it and always tied to it’s back story. There are no restrictions on what a Personal Situation can be other than it can’t provide a direct benefit to the character with out Invoking it and can only alter The Story when doing so. They are useful for providing story hooks, flushing characters back story's out and adds realism to the characters personal life.  


For example; a character that has a Good Attunement may have the Personal Situation of being the ‘Favorite Parishioner’ of his local priest growing up due to her piety. The same character may also have the Personal Situation of having been born on a high holy day which explains his Good Attunement. 


For example; A character has a Poor Means with their Means back story being they are in debt to the local crime syndicate. The player chooses to have the Personal Situation of having to deal with ‘Tony the Hand’, a syndicate enforcer. 


Purchasing Personal Situations
Personal Situations (PS)  are purchased by spending CP, usually 1 CP to per  PS, but the GM may determine a particular PS costs more. Unlike UA they do not have Ranks, rather they simply ‘are’, as the same PS can have a varying degree of influence on The Story depending on the situation and possibly how many Story Points the player spends to Invoke it during game play. 


Personal Situations in Game Play 
When an Personal Situations benefits you, you can spend Story Points to Invoke it for a bonus and when your  Personal Situations could complicate your character’s life, you can gain fate points back by calling a Compel on it. When they Invoke a PS they have to suggest a story arc, or Arc, as to how the PS benefits your character in the current situation and how it would alter The Story. If the GM agrees, then players’ Arc is added to The Story and the players gets the benefits of the Arc, likely with adjustments or limitations by the GM. Calling a Compel on a PS is the same as Invoking, but instead of the Arc costing SP and providing a benefit, Invoking earns the player SP but hinders the player in some way.


They can Invoke or call for a Compel on any of your Personal Situations whenever they’re relevant, and with the GM’s approval. The GM can also force a Compel for a character if they deem the Personal Aspect would automatically have an complicating effect on The Story. Forcing a Compel should be a rare event as normally if a GM thinks an Invoke is in order a simple suggestion to the player usually suffices for them to call it. 




Skills 
A skill describes something the character knows how to do and has some degree of competency in such as Athletics, Sword Fighting, Disguise, etc. which your character has gained through training, study or a lot of trial and error. Skills are the basis for everything your character actually does in the game that involves performing Actions, whether Opposed or Un-Opposed. Skills have Ranks, the higher the rank, the better your character is at the skill and successfully implementing them to a positive end. Taken together, your list of skills gives they a picture of your character’s potential for attempt at a glance—what they’re best at, what they’re okay at, and what they’re not so good at.


Skill Domains & Categories
Skills are separated into Domains of related skills, such as Academic, Artistic, Athletics and so on. Within these domains all  skills fall within one of 5 Skill Categories that give a general measure of how limited the character’s knowledge and ability would be due to having ranks in the given skill.


 A skill that falls in the Expansive Category would give the character a very wide range of knowledge and ability in many skills within the domain whereas a skill that falls within the Unique category would have an extremely narrow scope. For example, a character that has the expansive skill Melee Weapons would be familiar with and be able to use just about any melee weapon whereas a Unique skill would only allow the character to be adept as using a specific melee weapon such as their personal sword.






















Purchasing Skills
Like purchasing Aspects, it costs Character Points (CP) to purchase a Rank in a Skill, the cost of the rank is dependent on the Skills Category as shown in the chart in 2.4.1 Skill Domains & Categories. When a character first trains in a skill, that is, the first time the player spends CP to raise the skills rank, it’s default rank is considered to be Terrible. So a character that gains it’s first rank in say Broad Swords, would go from  the default rank of Terrible to a rank of Poor and each subsequent rank raises it by one, so purchasing 2 ranks in a new skill would raise it from Terrible to Mediocre. 


A character cannot start with any skill higher than the  Starting Cap of their power level nor can they raise a skill in a given Category above the category’s Cap. For example, a Mundane character cannot start with a rank in any skill higher than Average, can’t raise any Unique skill beyond Good, Specific skill above Fair and so on as the Power Level Skills chart  below shows. Most skills can be used without having spent any CP on the skills rank at the default rank of Terrible. However some skills such as those in the Magic Domain are not usually usable at all without training as the character has no frame of reference to even know where to begin.  


Personal Techniques 
When a character has achieved a Rank of Great or higher in at least one skill of all five categories within a skill Domain, they are considered to have developed a Personal Technique in that skill Domain. Personal Techniques have assorted effects on game play and The Story, the most common of which is providing the character with a free Reputation Personal Aspect.


 Like all great heroes(or Villians), your character no longer just swings a weapon, casts a spell or hacks a computer, they do it with a unique technique and style all on their own and people recognize them for it . As such, depending on the Domain and the campaign setting, most characters with Personal Techniques are usually well known, their Great skill rank acting as a Station or Worldliness Rank in relevant circles and situations. In addition all Attempt Rolls using a skill a character has a Technique in are at a +1 Talent Dice (to their benefit) per Rank above Good of the highest skill in the skill Domain. 
Lastly for each skill part 


Personal Techniques  are special tricks that your character knows that allow them to get an extra benefit out of a skill or give them a special ’technique’ that most people don’t have. Personal Techniques  are like special moves in a video game, letting them do something unique or distinctive compared to other characters.  Personal Techniques  indicate some special, privileged way a character uses a skill that is unique to whoever has that Personal Technique, which is a pretty common trope in a lot of settings—special or elite training, exceptional talents, the mark of destiny, genetic alteration, innate coolness, and a myriad of other reasons all explain why some people get more out of their skills than others do. Unlike skills, which are about the sort of things anyone can do in your campaign, Personal Techniques  are about individual characters.






Personal Technique Types
Skill Actions
  The most basic option for a Personal Technique is to allow a skill to do something that it normally can’t do. It adds a new attempt onto the base skill in certain situations, for those with this Personal Technique. This new attempt can be one that’s available to another skill (allowing one skill to swap for another under certain circumstances), or one that’s not available to any skill. 
Here are some new attempt Personal Techniques :


Backstab
They can use Stealth to make physical attacks, provided your target isn’t already aware of your presence. 


The Fight in the Dog. 
They can use Provoke to enter the kinds of contests that they’d normally need Physique for, whenever your ability to psych your opponent out with the force of your presence alone would be a factor. 


They’re Never Safe. 
They can use Burglary to make mental attacks and create advantages against a target, by staging a heist in such a way as to shatter their confidence in their security.




Skill Bonus
 Another use for a Personal Technique is to give a skill an automatic bonus under a particular, very narrow circumstance, effectively letting a character specialize in something. The circumstance should be narrower than what the normal attempt allows, and only apply to one particular attempt or pair of actions. 


The usual bonus is +20 to the skill total. However, if they want, they can also express the bonus as two shifts of additional effect after the roll succeeds, if that makes more sense. Remember, higher shifts on a roll allow your attempt to be more effective in certain ways. 


They can also use this to establish any effect worth two shifts as an additional benefit of succeeding at the skill roll. This might be Fair (+20) passive opposition, the equivalent of a 20-point hit, a mild consequence, or an advantage that takes Fair (+20) opposition to remove.


 Here are some examples of adding a bonus to an action:
 
 Arcane Expert.
 Gain a +20 bonus to create an advantage using Lore, whenever the situation has specifically to do with the supernatural or occult. • 


Lead in the Air. 
They really like emptying magazines. Any time they’re using a fully automatic weapon and they succeed at a Shoot attack, they automatically create a Fair (+20) opposition against movement in that zone until your next turn, because of all the lead in the air. (Normally, they’d need to take a separate attempt to set up this kind of interference, but with the Personal Technique, it’s free.) 


Child of the Court.
 Gain a +20 bonus to any attempt to overcome obstacles with Rapport when they’re at an aristocratic function, such as a royal ball.

        Science        
Specific
Specific academic skills tend to be refinements of the general skills: History becomes French History, American History and so on. Science becomes Chemistry, Physics and anything else appropriate. At this point, the advanced sciences are very similar to the roles of magical skills. They reinforce the specifics of the genre. In a science fiction game, for example, stardrive engineering might be a very important skill. Often, a game will have a specific selection of specific skills in conjunction with a more general list.




Language and Linguistics
The issue of languages is often a tricky one. The role of language is near and dear to many people’s hearts, and there are a number of ways they can be treated. 


When using broad skills, the Languages skill measures what languages the player knows: each rank over mediocre equates to one language when play begins. When using general skills, Languages are split into Linguistics (spoken languages) and literacy (written languages). Languages are learned in the same fashion as with the broad skill.


In Broad and General cases, languages are fairly binary: either they’re known or not. A poor grasp of a language may be played out, or considered a temporary hindrance, but is mostly in the realm of GM interpretation.


Under specific skills, each language or language family is its own skill. Skill level measures the character’s fluency: Average means a heavy accent, Fair is faintly detectable, and Good and better is flawless. At the GM’s discretion, the character may be forced to used the lower of a character’s language and social skill when attempting to use social skills in another language.

Combat
Combat Skills are the meat and drink of most games, so they get a somewhat richer treatment than many other skills. Broad combat skills are simple enough: Melee, Ranged and Unarmed. Specific skills are simply one skill per weapon type (Sword, Bow, Longsword and so on). Broad skills are where there are a few more options.

        Shuriken
        Staff
        Throwing Dagger
        Obviously, this list could extend pretty much indefinitely. Thankfully, it can generally be limited by the culture of the area the game occurs in.




General Combat Skill options
Either  of these options can work as broad combat skills. Neither option is really better than the other and the decision should hinge upon whichever approach the GM considers most thematically appropriate.


Option 1: Weapon Category Combat Skills
This list treats the category a weapon falls into as a general skill. In many ways this is potentially the most comprehensive list.
Bows - Bows, Crossbows
Brawling - Improvised weapons
One Handed Edged - Swords, Knives, Axes
One Handed Blunt - Maces, Clubs
Polearm - Halberd, Spetum, Staff
Shield - Facility with a shield - grants an additional +1 if used as skill for an all out defense
Thrown - Knife, Shuriken
Two Handed - Two-Handed Sword, Greataxe
Unarmed Combat - Boxing, Wrestling, Martial arts


Option 2: Style Based Combat Skills
This list is based off fighting styles, with the reasoning that a sword and shield fighter is not much different from a mace and shield fighter, practically speaking.
Archery - Bows and crossbows
Fencing - Fighting with light blades, knives, possibly cloaks and canes
Haft Weapon - Any weapon with a long haft, such as a spear, staff or polearm.
Improvisational - Fighting with whatever happens to be on hand.
Mounted - Fighting from horseback.
Single Weapon - Fighting with a weapon in one hand and nothing in particular in the other.
Thrown - Throwing things.
Two Handed - Non-hafted weapons large and heavy enough to require two hands.
Two Weapon - A Weapon in each hand. Other than looking cool, the main advantage of this style is the difficulty in disarming it.
Unarmed - Fighting unarmed, be it bare knuckle brawling or some manner of martial art.
Weapon and Shield - A one handed weapon in one hand, a shield in the other.


As an example, under this model, a character with archery at Good would be Good with any bow or crossbow he picked up.




Criminal
Criminal skills are exactly what they sound like, skills related to crime. 
Criminal Skills
Broad
        Larceny
        Stealth
General
        Fence
        Forgery
        Hide
        Lockpicking
        Pickpocket
        Sneak
        Streetwise        
Specific
Once again, the specific skills take the general skills and render them appropriate to a particular area or area of expertise. Skills would include things like Streetwise (New York) or Safecracking, Electronic Security Systems, Counterfeiting Money and so on.


Magical
Magical skills are probably the most genre dependent skills of them all. Some games will have none at all, some may have only one, and some many have many.  Ultimately, what skills are needed for the magic system is determined by the magic rules being used.


Perception
Perception skills are important in almost any game, with the distinction being what it is important to notice in the game.
Perception Skills
Broad
        Awareness
        Observation        
General
        Awareness

Specific
        Awareness
        Danger Sense
        Detect Lie
        Direction Sense
        Investigate
        Listen
        Locate Hidden
        Read Person
        Spot
        Surveillance


Levels of Perception
The main difference between many perception skills is a matter of when they’re applicable. At the broad level, Observation is used to spot things the character is looking for, and Awareness is for things that he’s not looking for, like surprises, or things he might happen to notice in a room. The general category breaks that down further. Awareness fills the same role, but Observation has been split into Search and Spot. Spot is used for quick checks, when the character is trying to take in details at a moment’s notice. Search is used when the character takes the time to look for something. The specific breakdown is similar, but many specialized tasks (like finding things that have been hidden) have their own skill.


Professional
Professional is a catch-all category, which includes most domestic, craft and professional skills, as well as most day to day skills.

Extraordinary Aspect (Exords)
As their name indicates, Extraordinary Aspects give characters access to powers and abilities above and beyond the ‘ordinary’ laws of their reality such as Magic, Psionics, Chi Powers and so on. They all fall into one of five categories depending on their nature and are used to product Reality Altering Effects (RAE) of various forms and functions, a number of which can be found in the RAE Library section.
Magic - when RAE are achieved through the occult, manipulation of mana,  deities, extra dimensional beings, etc.
Augments - when RAE are achieved thru the augmentation of the physical structure of a character such as in the case of Super Powers, Mutations, Extraordinary Racial abilities, etc.
Disciplines - when RAE are achieved by mental manipulations alone such as with Psionics, Focusing Chi, ‘Force of Will’, etc.
High Science - when RAE are achieved by a sciences so advanced it is indistinguishable from ‘magic’ even to those who employ it. Often the result of accidental scientific discoveries, a High Science’s underpinning laws are rarely fully understood if at all, which can be a challenge to those who possess it.
 Other - Things we can’t think of.




such as fire balls, teleportation, animating the dead, un-aided flight and so on.will have a major defining impact on the Characters story  but do not fall under any of the other types of Aspects. Since Extraordinary Aspects are a ‘catch-all’ Aspect that can cover a wide range of Aspects we have provided some examples of the most common types of Extraordinary Aspects In the following sections,  some or all may not appropriate for your game. The best way to design a characters Extraordinary Aspect is to work with the GM while the player describes what they want the character to be able to do and the GM deciding on the Aspect type (Magic,Psionic,etc.) , the CP points for acquiring it, whether or not it is Ranked, limitations and so on. 


Associated Skills
Depending on the type of Extraordinary Aspect, the GM may require that the player purchase skills or possibly a series of skills in cases like Magic & Psionics that enable them to use it efficiently. For example, while usually no skill roll may be needed to fly with the Extraordinary Aspect Superpower - Flight, the ability to make intricate maneuvers in close combat without slamming into a wall might require an Un-Opposed Attempt against a specialized Flying skill. Of course the GM may simply say that no roll is needed for any flying maneuver with a Flight Power or only for special maneuvers, in adverse condition and so on. Another common skill required for attack style Super Powers is Throwing, such as when hurling balls of fire or bolts of energy at a foe. Again,  the GM might rule that being able to aim and accurately release such energy comes with the power for free with no roll needed and it automatically hits the target every time unless the targeting is something that can dodge, making it an Opposed Action.  


Exord systems
Adventure Party has a number of different mechanics systems to choose from when handling  Extraordinary Aspects. The systems all act as  universal 'powers' system to cover magic, Psionics, super powers and other Extraordinary Aspects. (needs more info)


SYSTEMS
RAE Based 
The first system is based on the powers themselves, or Reality Altering Effects (RAE) as they will be referred to from here out. Similar to the traditional 'spell level' concept,  it uses Ranks to measure  the degree to which each RAE alters reality 'from the norm'.  Simple RAEs’ such as producing light or sound make up the lowest Ranks, with the RAE increasing in rank and scale from there to collapsing stars or calling down planets on ones enemies. 
Characters gain access and control of RAE thru purchasing Extraordinary Aspects, for example to gain access to Flight and Levitation RAE’s a character may purchase a Extraordinary Aspect such as Super Powered Flight,  Wind Magic, Telekinetic Psionics and so on. 


The third system is based on Schools & Realms, where a School dictates what they can DO and the Realm is the source of your RAE's and how they manifests. Somewhat a hybrid of the first two, if they are skilled (or have an Aspect) in the School of  War and the Realm of Earth they would have access to anything from Stone Skin to Earth Quake RAE . 
All of these systems will be working off of a common "RAE Library" with each RAE having all the required meta data to support each system. In this way a character could easily be 'migrated' to another system and the system could easily be combined. In support of these three system (if they all work) there will be a layer of additional skills, aspects and other mechanics that will allow further customization such as skills/aspect to just improve power range, AOE, reduce "cast" time, etc. 




Casting Based 
In the second system particulars such as range, duration, casting time, degree to which they alter reality, etc. are based on how the RAE is based on the Casting Method .  For example Wizardry is slower to cast than Psionics but is more powerful when both are bringing about the same RAE.  This system allows for characters to 'pull' more 'power' than they are 'Ranked' for, making it particularly suitable for 'High Magic' settings. It also includes rules for 'Going Mad Mage' and other assorted nastiness for those that push beyond their abilities too far or two often. 


Magic 
Magic comes in one of two flavors; the first is the art of influencing events through manipulation of mana, a magical energy  that magic users can detect (or even create) and manipulate to alter matter, time and space. The second is through compelling some greater being (Extra-dimensional being, Deity, Demonic Force, etc.) to perform magic or bring about  “Miracles” at the behest of the character. The exact details of where a character draws their magical powers from and how they wield them are governed by their Magic Source and Casting type.


Magic Source : As the name implies, this is the source of the magical power a character wields, each unique Extraordinary Aspect : Magic must have it’s own Magic source. So a character that both types of magic might power their mana manipulation magic with Innate Mana and their Miracles with Granted Magic. 
Innate Mana (Evocation based) - The character has a natural reserve of magical power they are able to draw from to power magical effects. The reserve is part of their very being that is always available to them and can not be disrupted by “Normal” means, such as in a null magic field, magic suppression technology, where magic doesn’t exist and so on. Every effect the character causes drains some level of magic from their reserve depending on how drastic the effect is with regards to alter reality from its norm. If a character uses up all their magic and they abstain drawing on it, their reserve will regenerate over time. A resting character will recover faster than one that does not and a character that sleeps will recover faster than one that is just resting. Innate mana users can continue to draw power after their reserve are gone but doing so physically and mentally injures them regardless of how powerful the spell is they are casting. Prolonged overtaxed use  will eventually kill. Likewise, a character that draws a large amount of magical energies that they have in reserve will damage them in the same manner, and an effect that requires far more power will kill them outright. The rate that effects use magical energy and the size of the reserve is based on the character’s Evocation, as such a character must have at least a fair evocation to have Innate magic.
Channeled (Bearing Based) - The character draws raw magical power from an outside source such as the ambient magic power surrounding them, a powerful magic crystal, the “Death Force” , a dimensional rift emanating power and so on. They can safely draw only as much power at once as their Bearing allows, beyond which they risk loosing control of the power they harnessed, often  to catastrophic and deadly results. 
The total amount of power a character can channel over time is directly dependent on the source; as long as the source is available and providing power, it can be channeled. If a caster stays within their ‘safe zone’, channeling only the power they can safely handle they do not have a limit to the amount of spells they can cast nor does it fatigue them unduly. However, when a caster cast out of their safe zone, doing so progressively Stresses them both Physically, Spiritually and  especially Mentally. As a side effect of  moderate “Channeling Stress” is the Channeler looses their ability to judge the amount of power they are drawing resulting in ever increasing amounts of power drawn that are also increasingly stressing and hard to control. At a certain point characters under sustained Channeling Stress go completely mad; their minds and soul succumbing to the chaos of the arcane storm that rages through them . This unfortunate condition is known as going ‘Mad Wizard’ and those that contract it are usually hunted down and slain for the potential damage they can do on a wide scale. That is assuming the magic maelstrom doesn’t kill them outright selves off, not to mention most of the people around them.
Granted (Attunement Based) - Magic is “Granted” by a supernatural power, usually an Elder God, New God, or possibly a Daemon in the form of specific magical powers, spells or effects. The amount of magic a character has access to is dependent on how much sway they  hold with the supernatural power and  the amount of attention they can command. The nature of the magic granted depends on the nature of the grantor and possibly the relationship they have with the character. Characters that use Supernatural magic usually have a very close and personal relationship with their supernatural benefactor and may even have indirect, and on rare occasions, direct contact with the source of their power. The nature of this relationship and contact can vary widely, from a hostile relationship as with a wizard binding a demon to his will to an the beneficent and loving relationship between an Elder God and  a favored worshiper. The greatest danger to a character using granted magic is overstepping their ability to contain and control a hostile power, such with a bound demon, and allowing the power to break free to turn on its former captor. Characters that are freely granted magic by a friendly supernatural power are not generally in danger of being directly attacked by the power they traffic with, however the enemies of said power are a different story all together. 
Law (Intelligence based) - The character uses knowledge of the fundamental laws of existence to do “Tricks”  that alter reality to their liking. Users of Law Magic are in truth, not using magic but rather employing a very advanced science, though magical energies are often released in the process.  While the mechanics of Law magic are entirely based on knowledge and skill, a Superb or better Perception or Bearing is required to comprehend the concepts underlying it and a higher than Average Intelligence to do even the simplest of ‘Tricks”. One of the most powerful types of ‘Magic’ , it’s use is extremely rare, usually confined to the most powerful and unique of entities. Practitioners of Law Magic have to be particular careful with their craft for if not properly executed things can go horrible wrong, as in I just turned gravity off in the  entire universe horribly wrong.
Conversion (Variable)- A non-magical energy such as heat, bio-electricity, momentum, etc. is ‘converted’ into magic energy that is then used to power RAE’s. 






Casting Methods
Casting method is the Aspect a character uses to manipulate magical forces or compel greater beings to bring about magical or miraculous effects. For each Magic Extraordinary Aspect the character takes, they should have a casting method for that Magic Aspect. So a character that has both types of magic might wield their mana manipulation magic with Harmonic Casting and their Miracles with Faith Casting. 




Harmonic (Good+ Attunement required)- The most natural way to manipulate magic, Harmonic Casting is a spiritual discipline rooted in directing the flow of magical energy along the ‘paths of least resistance’ within nature and ‘organically’ bringing about the effects desired. As an example, a ‘healing spell’ cast using Harmonic Casting might require the use of mud spread on the wound, the magic enhancing the natural anti-bacterial and healing properties of the plants and microbes in the mud itself. Harmonic Casting, as its name implies, tends to stay in harmony with nature and generally is not used to drastically alter it, though it is more than capable of altering entire solar systems and indeed entire star systems if done at the behest of and with the willing aid of ‘Natures Spirit’ or the equivalent in the game world. To use Harmonic Casting, a character must be “Nature kin” meaning their souls have been bonded to “Natures Sprit” and through this connection they are able to use Harmonic Casting. The source of this bounding is wide and varied, examples being racial Aspects, born “under a Sign”, having visited a sacred grove and so on. 


Wizardry (Bearing Based) - The most versatile of the casting methods, wizardry “binds” magical energies together, mastering and controlling the forces they summon with shear force of will to bring about the desired effect. As such wizardry is considered a very ‘aggressive’ style of casting and lends its self to combat magic, alteration of reality, and peering deep into the mysteries of space and time. As an example, a healing spell cast using wizardry may result in a directional beam of bright light that heals any character it strikes an amount of health over time. Practitioners of Wizardry often employ  special focal points, such as a staff or wand, to assist them in their casting, often using them to help manipulate the magic or amplify its power or effects. 


Thaumaturgy (Intelligence based / 2 other Casting Methods Great+) - The “Scientific” way of controlling magic, Thaumaturgy manipulates magical energies by employing a wide range of other casting methods in conjunction with  magical and non-magical devices in a methodical and calculated way based on an ever evolving library of Thamaturgic Theories and Laws. Thaumaturgists often come to Thaumaturgy by way of first developing a number of other Casting Methods, often only gaining the most basic knowledge and abilities needed to even start their Thamaturgist Career until at least mid way through a life long pursuit of magic as as such there are no novice magic users employing Thaumaturgy. This is perhaps a good thing as the power of Thaumaturgy that a properly executed Thaumaturgy ’Event” (Thamaturgist don’t cast ’spells’) will be ten times more powerful as a ‘spell’ from another casting type using the same amount of magical energies. 
Thaumaturgy is an extremely precise endeavor that often takes a long period of time to prepare and enact an ‘Event’ making it far more suited to a Lab than a battle field, let along a cramped confines of a natural cave or enemy stronghold. As such, most Thaumaturgist employ an array of magical artifacts, devices, constructs, techno-magical devices  and any other items that they can imbue with magical properties through their discipline. 


Rune & Glyph Craft (Perception or Speed Based)
Instinctual(?)-Reserved to those characters that have some natural magic power that they can use ‘like another appendage.’ Instinctual casting is the fastest, most accurate type of casting. Indeed, basic usage of an innate power can become so familiar to a character that it develops into a unconscious reattempt resulting in instant cast times. Advanced practitioners of Instinctual casting can develop new ways of manifesting their innate power, allowing for effects differing from the “Base Power” and characters with multiple innate powers can combine them with sufficient rank in Instinctual Casting. An example of an combining innate powers with advanced Instinctual casting would be a healing power using a characters innate ice dart and self regeneration power to launch healing shards of ice into distant allies from a distance. In some extreme cases, characters that routinely cast the same spell day in and day out multiple times a day using a different casting method may eventual develop an ability to instinctually cast the spell as if it was an innate power. 


Psionics: any power that involves mind over matter, time or space. Psionics often require training in skills called Disciplines to effectively use, otherwise the user could risk assorted negative consequences or have no conscious control over their psionic abilities. 
Will power also determines the characters ability to tap into innate mental abilities and manifest Psi-Powers which like magic a character may or may not have access to depending on the circumstances. A player that wants to play a PSI or Magic wielding character should check with the GM before making the character.


Superpowers: any supernormal power that is an inherent ability, whether because of mutation, exposure to radiation, a gift of space aliens, etc., or granted by a device, such as an alien-science belt. Examples of superpowers can be found in many comic books, and include super hearing, the ability to see through walls, cling to ceilings, become invisible, etc.


Cybernetic Enhancement: any mechanical or electronic enhancement to the characters body that gives the character extra powers, enhances existing abilities or grants new ones, or provides some other significant advantage to the character.
Bio-Augment: any biological enhancement to a character’s body through Gene Therapy, Bio-Engineering, Symbiotic implants and so on that give the character extra powers, enhances existing abilities or grants new ones, or provides some other significant advantage to the character.
Extraordinary Races: While most fantasy and science fiction campaigns have multiple normally playable races there are always those that have abilities and powers way beyond the “norm”, are considered ’monsters,’ or are normally non-player races. These races are considered Extraordinary and require the purchase of the Extraordinary Race Aspect to play as a Character.

Character Development  
Races 


In Adventure Party, Races are either created as part of the Character Development  process as a collaborative effort between the Player and GM to fit the campaign or in the case of existing races the player generates their character so as to meet the requirements of the Race or Pursuit.


Races do not provide modifiers to character abilities, skills or other traits as they do in many traditional style RPGs but rather provide a framework to use when deciding on character Origin, Integration into the campaign setting, and  assigning CP to Aspects.


When creating a new Race the player does so by including them in their Character Concept, Origin and Integration stories along with spending CP on the necessary Aspects to give them the traits the Race and/or Pursuit would have. 


For example, a player wants to make a classic Elven Archer in a campaign where elves have yet to be included, and the GM is open to adding them. Prior to or even during character development the player and GM will work out what exactly Elves, and Elven Archers,  are to get a rough idea of their history, how they fit in society, general Aspects, etc.; basically the who, what, where and when of how they fit into the campaign setting. Next they agree on all the Aspects that would define that race or pursuit, and the player spends the Character Points accordingly during character generation. In the case of an elven archer, they may lower their Strength and Constitution below Average and raise their Dexterity, Perception, Intelligence, and Evocation above Average. They may also purchase Life Aspects to account for any benefits (or negatives) to their ‘Elven Society’ such as Means to have access to ‘Elven’ equipment, reduced Station due anti-Elf prejudices, etc. From there they can spend points on Personal and Extraordinary Aspects for any special racial or pursuit abilities like superior vision, weightless walking, skill bonuses, etc.


When creating a character of a pre-existing Race  the player simply has to refer to the relevant details and stay within the Aspect requirements.

Vocations
Vocations are a set of skills, abilities and ways of doing things that represent how your character goes about performing the ‘duties’ of their day to day job ( aka Profession) but are not unique to them like Techniques. While at first blush they look like the ‘classes’ of other systems Vocations come into play after a character increases sufficiently in Skills and Aspects.  To ‘Advance’ in a particular  Vocation the character must attain the required rank in both the Attribute Aspects and Skills for each Rank of a Vocation, beginning at no Rank at all.
Consider: Dars the wild aspires to be a well known Rune Lord,  but she is fresh out of her parents house and has neither the skills nor abilities to claim the Vocation, so she is spending all her Character Points on Ber, Int, Per and Spd then her skill points on Runes, Glyphs and Survival.  By the end of her fifth adventure she manages to raise all her stats to Fair (+10) and her skills  to Runes 20, Glyphs 10 & Survival 10 as needed to satisfy the requirements for her first rank of the Rune Lord Vocation. Dars can now claim to be a Rune Lord in truth and she has access to Vocational Skills  & Knowledge at Abysmal Rank .  In this way Vocations are a measure of what a character has truly achieved through game play , what they have done and concentrated on developing. 
Dars continues her adventures, even changing her name to Dars Wild Rune to claim her new vocation, and plying that vocations title for the extra jobs, prestige and profits it brings. For the next five adventures she continues her goal to advance in ranks as a Rune Lord, this time only needing to advance her skills as the +10 bonus from her Fair (+10) Attributes counts for two ranks (10/5=2) and advancing to the Second Rank of Rune Lord.
RUNE LORD
    This Character type trains predominantly in rune crafts.  They often wander from place to place in search of new and more powerful runes.   This type of character can become very powerful after acquiring a large number of runes.

Vocational Skills  & Knowledge 
Ranks in vocation also represent ‘Vocation Skills & Knowledge’, things that a person of that Vocation would just know or skills they would have from ’on the job training’ which are at the same Rank as the Vocation.   The same goes for a network of contacts, acquaintances, sources of information, jobs or supplies and so on directly related to the activates of the Vocation. Both the Vocation Knowledge and the Vocation Network are confined to and by the characters own Life Aspects. This means they would know things and people in their ‘Circle’ but not necessarily outside of it that associate with their Vocation. A character is considered to have Vocation  Knowledge & Network at the rank of the relevant Vocation and is free to use it as any other Skill or Aspect in game play without limitations. 
A Character can have  more than one Vocation, though they can only use a skill or ability enhancement for one single rank of a specific Vocation. Different Vocation Knowledge & Network ranks do not stack, however the GM (and the PC with Story Points) is free to declare a ‘Synergy’ which means one Vocations Skill might enhance (or even impede) another's in a multi-Vocation character.


The following is not an exhaustive list of Vocations but  something to get they started with limited descriptions for they to build on as they will. They can easily add your own by using the simple 20 Attributes & 40  Skill bonus per lever requirements cost rule and working with your GM to work it into the game world.

The Rundown
The Rundown contains short descriptions of every major and many minor concepts in the Adventure Party Role Playing System. It is provided here with the intention of being used as a primer on the system as well as a quick reference guide. 
Story: the most important concept in the game, the story is just that, the story told through game play of the character’s challenges, triumphs and failures as well as the people, places and things they encounter during their adventures in the world they live in. Above all else, The Story is  the main measure of ‘winning and losing’ in Adventure Party; ‘IT WAS EPIC!’ story is the goal of Adventure Party and is considered a win.
Story Points (SP): one of the most important resources available to a player in Adventure Party, they’re a measure of how much influence they  have to make the story go in your character’s favor.  Players can ‘Lead’ the story by having their character say or do something that significantly effects it by advancing the current story arc or over all plot.  Story Points are spent to ‘Direct’ the story, which allows the player greater control over the current story arc and what occurs to their character in it. Whether  the player is Leading or Directing the direction they take the story needs to be based on a Trait, Personality or Personal Situation of their character.
Refresh (RFS): the number of Story points they get to add to any left over from the last game session at the start of every game session to spend for your character. -  Might eliminate the free SP at the start of every game session but will have to see.
Character (PC / NPC): any person or creature that inhabits the world in which the game play takes place. Characters controlled by the player are called Player Characters or PC’s; all other characters are controlled by the GM and are referred to as Non-Player Characters or NPC’s. 
Character Points (CP): Character Points are the cash of Character Development  - they use them to "buy" certain types of Aspects such as Universal Aspects, Skill Ranks, etc. during Character Development  and advancement.
Race: what species your character belongs to. Race has a major and wide ranging impact on your character as they govern what Aspects they must select and develop and possibly the range, type or ranks of skills during character creation.
Skills (SKL): anything a character knows how to do that isn't an Aspect and can be improved through practice. The default for a skill a character is not trained in is usually Poor, though that can vary up or down a little depending on Aspects that might affect certain Skills. There are a couple exceptions to this, like magic skills that most people don’t have at all.
Aspect: anything that describes a character (or anything else for that matter) that is not a learned skill. An Aspect can be an attribute, innate ability,  skill aptitude, inherited gift, fault, super-normal power, or any other feature that describes a character that is not a skill. (or object.) 
Universal Aspects (UA): Aspects that every Character in the game world has to some degree. Characters are considered to have all Aspects at an Average rank unless modified during character creation, game play or character advancement. Universal Aspects fall into either Attributes Aspects, which describe a character’s physical, mental or mystical Aspects; or Life Aspects, which describe key Aspects of their life.  
Personal Situations (PS): Personal Situations don’t give the character any extra powers, items, abilities or other tangible things like Aspects; instead, they give those Aspects ’flavor’ or meaning. They are rooted in an Aspects, arising as a consequence of having it and always tied to it’s back story. There are no restrictions on what a Personal Situation can be other than it can’t provide a direct benefit to the character with out Invoking it and can only alter The Story when doing so. They are useful for providing story hooks, flushing characters back story's out and adds realism to the characters personal life.  
Rank (Rnk): a measure of the degree of a given Aspect and used to adjust dice rolls up or down when rolling for the results of an Action. Ranks are described by one of eleven adjectives along with a score: Abysmal/-40, Terrible/-30, Poor/-20, Mediocre/-10, Average/0, Fair/+10, Good/+20, Great/+30, Superb/+40, Epic/+50, and Legendary/+60. 
Actions & Attempt Rolls: when a character attempts to do something that the GM determines they would not be automatically successful at, that is considered an Action. Actions come in two flavors; an Un-Opposed Attempt is when they are trying to do something that is not being challenged by another character, such as disarming a trap or climbing a wall, and Opposed Attempt when another character (or other force) is actively trying to prevent them from succeeding. Both types of attempts may require the player to make an attempt roll by rolling the dice to determine the outcome, regardless of this roll is known as the Attempt Roll.
Aspect Cap (CAP): at certain points in the game a character may not be able to raise a particular Aspect Cap above a given rank; this is called a Cap. The term Aspect Cap is rarely used as more specific terms will be used to better describe what the Cap  is on, such as Skill Cap for skills, Aspect Cap for Aspects. and so on. Regardless of the exact term, these are all Aspect Caps that limit a character’s  maximum rank in whatever the Cap is on.
Aspect Floor (FLR): the same but opposite of i, as in an Aspect can not go below its floor.
Vocations: a set of skills, abilities, and ways of doing things that represent how your character goes about performing the ‘duties’ of their day to day job ( aka Profession) but are not unique to them like Techniques. 
Pursuit : where a character’s Vocation is ‘how’ they go about accomplishing their  day to day activates, their Pursuit  dictates what those activities are and are usually towards a long term goal, way of life, or employment and is generally reflective who they are and what  they are about.
Harm :  the term used to indicate the result of an attempt that will cause hurt,  damage, or otherwise negatively impact a characters physical, mental or spiritual condition, ie cause Stress or Injury to something.

Editor Notes
General Notes V1.2
Grammatical errors are highlighted. A sticky note at the end of each relevant paragraph explains what to do with them.


Are they planning on copyrighting the name AGGS? If so, they might want to add in the copyright symbol whenever they use it in the rulebook.


Some grammatical issues are just consistency issues. If they start out capitalizing/italicizing Life Aspects, for example, do it throughout and so forth.


Except where noted, everything seems pretty well thought out and easy to follow. Some areas could use a few mock character examples as noted below.




The Rundown
Story Points - They might include a note at the end of the paragraph saying where “compel” is further explained.


Attempt Rolls - First sentence describing this is somewhat confusing. I think if they broke it into separate sentences it would make more sense.


Check the other sections for sticky notes regarding grammar, spelling, etc.


The Character and the Story
There are a few agreement errors that they can choose to fix or ignore. For example, they have a singular noun (character), but a plural pronoun to describe the character (their). Sometimes this can be confusing. If they choose to change it, the easiest way to do it is to change the noun to plural and make sure the objects are plural as well. It’s not that big of a deal, but it’s something I notice from my composition background.
For example,
“It also affords the player a solid foundation from which to build their continuing character stories.
Changes to
It also affords the players solid foundations from which to build their continuing character stories.


This has happened in the Rundown, just more prevalent here. If they decide to change them, I can go back through from the beginning and rewrite alternatives throughout further drafts. As I said it is more of a technical issue; however, in some areas it can affect clarity.


Races, Pursuits, & Vocations
This seems well described, just some grammatical issues.


The Story
Seems easy to follow, see notes on grammatical issues.


The Mechanics
1.4.1 Ranks in Actions - Maybe provide a more detailed mock-up for both an Opposed and Unopposed. Such as what would happen if a character rolled “example” against the good ranked wall.


2.3.2 Personal Situations in Game Play - Like above, maybe create a mock situation where a character might use a Compel.


Magic - Good, clear descriptions of magic used throughout


Stress and Injury  - Descriptions are good. However, as they noted, it might help to have the examples of the Stress and Injury  Tracks


Vocations - Perhaps alphabetize list
General Comments V1.3
Eventual numbering/outline system - most likely will take shape as the rules are expanded.


More writing in “active” tense. A lot of sentences are like this one (passive), which is the subject is followed by a linking verb (are, is, were, etc). For example if they had the sentence “Characters are defined by Aspects,” this could be rewritten to “Aspects define the characters.” It’s a stronger sentence, and it also doesn’t bog down the flow of reading. Often times a mix between passive and active sentence works best.


There are a few areas where the sentences look like they might have extra spaces within them. I didn’t highlight these because I didn’t know if they were part of the way font and line spacing works. If not, I can highlight these on future edits.




The Basics
Continuity issues with Personal Situations and Aspect Caps, such as capitalization and italics. See highlights and Sticky Notes.




Trait Tables, Crunchy
The description for how they roll to decide World View and Fears is confusing to me along with how Rank gets added into it. For example for World view, are they rolling 1d2 to find out how many times they roll a d6 on the table? What if they roll higher than a 6 as they have the potential to roll 7 through 12 as well? If this is true, how do they roll a 25 or 26 on Fears as 6x4=24. Also is number 1 on Fears missing on purpose, not an eligible roll? I guess I got a little confused here. 




2.3.2 Personal Situations in Game Play
Continuity issue with Personal Situations, Compel, and Invoke should be italicized. See highlights and sticky notes.




Universal Aspects
Should they be italicized like Life Aspects, Personal Situations, and Attribute Aspects?


My vote would be No, because they are not specialized like the others are; however, since they are in the same category as the above I thought I should point that they weren’t and see if this was on purpose.






Notes to Reader


The majority of the core concepts/mechanics are in place but few sections are complete, most need at least examples.
Red Text is either unfinished material, to-do notes or comments to the reader asking for input.
The majority of the core concepts/mechanics are in place but few sections are complete, most need at least examples.
Yes, I said that twice.
It needs a whole ‘tech’ side, most of it is slanted towards the ‘spell caster’ side of things.
Things not kosher
Examples -> Needed through out the text, will pair with example images
Skills ->Needs flushed out & balanced
Extraordinary Aspects - > LOTS of rules and examples needed
        The Spells list is a raw dump, will be detailed, expanded and integrated as a universal list to draw from for all Extraordinary Aspects ie. Fireball  details will work as a spell to a super power to a tech effect.
Races - > Raw dump from archived work, need to integrate
Extraordinary Aspects - > Only has 1 of 3 planned systems.




Derived Statistics
Crunchy


Derived Statistics provide more refined and specific scores for the purposes of Skill Bases, Attempt Modifiers, tracking combat,  etc. than using  Attribute Aspects alone.
Combat Stats
Dodge (DGD)
 (DEX  + PER) / 2 : The character’s ability to avoid being struck by physical attacks against their body. 
Accuracy - Strike (ASK) 
 (DEX + PER) / 2 : The character’s ability to score a hit when physically attacking an opponent with a melee weapon or an unarmed combat maneuver.   
Accuracy - Ballistic (ABC)
(DEX + PER +BER) / 3 : The character’s ability to score a hit when attacking an opponent with an aimed ranged weapon with an arching projectile/beam path.
Accuracy - Directed (ADR) (DEX + PER + INT ) / 3 : The character’s ability to score a hit when attacking an opponent with an aimed  ranged weapon having a direct , non-arching path.
Damage Resistance (DR)  (0): The amount of protection a character has from physical damage due to protective devices and features, such as  innate defenses, worn armor, magical protection and so on.  When a character takes physical damage the total damage, taken is reduced by the characters DR. 
Derived Stats—Con.
Crunchy


Attempt  Points (AP)
(STR + DEX + BER + PER + INT + HLT)/ 6 : The measure of a character’s ability to complete tasks within a specific timeframe, mainly used during Attempt Time. The higher the character’s AP the more attempts they are able to successfully complete, the more accurate they are in managing successive tasks, awareness of changing conditions, ability to stay on task and so on in a Round, the smallest measurement used in Attempt Time.  In Attempt Time each attempt cost an amount of AP and when a character reaches zero AP it can’t take any pro-active attempts for the remainder of that round except to defend against attacks . The character gains AP every round equal to it's AP score and  AP costs can be spread across rounds, enabling a character to preform attempts  that  it does not have enough AP to execute in a single round. When doing so the player expends what AP they have to start the attempt and in successive rounds expending their AP until the cost is met at which point the attempt is considered complete. During the rounds between starting and ending the attempt’ the character considered to be Committed to the attempt and’ depending on what the attempt is’ they may or may not be able to stop or change attempts until complete. 


MANEUVERING POINTS(MP)
 AP X 3 X RACE MOD: Maneuvering points represents the amount of distance a character can physically travel in a single combat round during Encounter Time.


WILL POWER                                     WP = BER/4 : Will power determines your character's innate ability to command and  control  magical energies in order to cast spells and use some magical items. Most races do not have any natural WP enhancements and some lack the ability to use magic all together. 


Casting Points  
BER: Casting Point's are used in the same manner as Attack Points, but instead of being used to  commit  physical attempt they are spent to cast spells. A character gains an amount of Casting Point's per round equal to it's Casting Point Score and they can be stored from one round to the next. 
MAGIC CHANNELING (MC)
(BER + EVO )/ 4: In order to use magic a character must be have an  MC score equal to or higher than the Magical Power(MP) of the magic they are trying to wield and the difference determines how taxing it is for the caster.  For example, a character that has an MC of 100 can channel 10 or 20 MP magic all day long, but would have to rest periodically after channeling 30-40 MP magic's and would be down and out for perhaps days after channeling 100 MP magic. These effects can be mitigated by certain .trainings (Spell Casting, Channeling, certain Disciplines, exc.) and can be exacerbated if the character complety fumbles the attempt. The effects of a failure can be anything from a slight headache to sudden death to a rift in the fabric of space depending on the degree of failure and the amount of power involved.z

Trait Play (SP)
Of equal importance is the that vast majority of a characters advancement is dependent on the players ability to accurately portray the characters traits through role play. This is because CP are awarded by fellow players from an Award Pool set by the GM at the beginning of game and the players themselves award CP from that pool to other players based on accurate portrayals of their characters Traits and Personality. This keeps the focus of incentives squarely on role playing and the player always cognizant of how they are playing their character fostering a cohesive Character Story and game play.

They can be raised and lowered like other Aspect however the CP effect for Fears is reversed; Lowering cost CP and raising pays. The higher the Rank the stronger the Fear and the GM may (suggested) limit the number of high rank Fears a character is allowed.

Each player who is creating a new character rolls 1d6, this is the order (highest to lowest) in which the GM will pick players to detail how a trait (chosen by the GM) relates to their chosen personality for their character out loud to the GM and the rest of the players.  Play continues in this way until all traits for all characters are detailed.
Character Development
Generation Play
To quote the first entry in The Rundown, The Story is the most important concept in the game of Adventure Party and is the only real measure of ‘winning and losing’ in the game.  As such, telling the shared story is the central goal of game play for both the GM and Players with each focused on a different story facet and playing different roles in writing the Story over all.


 The GM’s focus is on the Campaign Story, and it is their role to not only introduce the players to that world and allow them to experience all its diversity, wonder, and most likely frequent terror but also structure the adventures in such a way as to help the players weave an ‘Epic’ story.  The Player’s role is to first describe their character in great detail and then tell their lives' story through role play and dice rolls when necessary. But more importantly, it is their role to Role Play their character as a member of an Adventure Party, for in truth, that is where the heart of the story lies. The interaction between the characters and how the shared events, adventures, triumphs, and tragedies effect their relationships and lives is the source of all great RPG stories and is the focus of the players’ role in Adventure Party. 


The characters story, and ideally the party’s story, begins with character creation during a story driven part of game play called Generation Play, or Gen-Play play for short. Gen-Play starts with the GM deciding on (or stating for on-going games) a Power Level for the new PC(s) and detailing the campaign world so the players know their options for Race, Vocations, Pursuits, etc., and have a basic understanding of the world their character inhabits.  The players then progress through the Gen-Play steps (see chart this page) , ‘detailing’  each Aspect by telling a (very) short story to describe how that Aspect manifests itself in their character, usually to the entire play group, and then recording it in the appropriate section of the character sheet. Further rules and instructions are supplied in the side bar on Gen-Playing the different steps when relevant later in the later sections The GM (when making NPCs), solo players and game groups who don’t want to role play their character generation can simply ignore Gen-Play all together, writing their Character Story out as they see fit with the approval of the GM when required.

Attempts 
When a character attempts to do something that the GM determines they would not automatically be successful at, it is considered an Attempt which come in two flavors, Opposed and Unopposed. An Unopposed Attempt is when a character is trying to do something that is not being challenged by another character or force,  such as disarming a trap or climbing a wall. An Opposed Attempt when another character or other force is actively trying to prevent them from succeeding.

Unopposed Attempts
 when a character is trying to do something that is not being challenged by another character or force,  such as disarming a trap or climbing a wall. 


Opposed Attempts
when another character or other force is actively trying to prevent them from succeeding.  


Attempt Roll (AR)  
1d100 + Talent Dice +Skill 
Both Opposed and Un-Opposed Attempts require rolling the dice to determine the outcome, this is called the Attempt Roll. When the dice are rolled for an Attempt Roll there will be a target Difficulty Rank and a corresponding Difficulty Score. The total of the player’s roll + adjustments must (normally) equal or exceed the Difficulty Score for them to be successful in controlling the result of their attempt.


 On any Attempt Roll, ie to hit, picking a lock, casting a spell, etc. if the player is 'successful' they get to decide the  outcome of their attempt, if not, the GM gets to decide. How much the player or GM gets to 'control' the story is based on much they succeed or fail by. I think it will take the game play even further into story telling through Role Play and away from Roll Play. Of course, the companion Crunchy rules will provide 


Example: the GM may decide the lock on a door has a Good (70) Rank and would be an Un-Opposed Attempt to pick it. The player consults the appropriate skill to check their rank, asks the GM how many Talent Dice they get for the Roll,  rolls the dice(1d100+Talent Dice) adding the rank bonus to the roll of their Locks skills (or whatever skill or attribute applies), and compares the outcome to the rank difficulty. If the outcome is equal to or higher than the difficulty, it's a success; if not, it's a failure.  


When two opponents are actively competing against each other in an attempt, such as during an attack,  it is considered an Opposed Action. The two parties involved, usually the GM and a Player, both make Actions Rolls as they would in an Un-Opposed Attempt but in an Opposed Attempt the character with the highest total score is the ‘winner’ of the action.  


Example :In the case of a player attacking a monster, player & GM both roll adding mods, player for PC, GM for monster. The PC wins by 20 points, which is 2 Ranks in the system. That can be looked up on a chart to get some numbers on how 'severe' that would be. So the player gets to decide what happens when they attack the monster to the tune of 2 Ranks, be that damage, the PC escaping, etc. 


Margin of Success & Failure (MoSF) 
The difference between the two scores in an Attempt Roll is called the margin of success & failure and is used to determine just that; how well the character succeeded or how badly they failed at the Action. Exactly how that impacts the character and the target of their attempt is entirely relative to the attempt itself.

Stress & Injury 
When characters find themselves in harm’s way—a fairly common occurrence when facing adventure, intrigue and danger at every turn—there are two levels of harm they can sustain: Stress and Injury. Stress is a characters final defense against taking Injury from the many perils they face in their daily survival. When all their gear, skills, powers and the player fails them, they can fall back on their Stress to avoid Injury. A twist away in the nick of time, barely blocking a mental blow, or a last glimmer of faith to defend against damnation are all examples of characters taking Stress while avoiding Injury. Injury is just that, straight forward lasting damage that will require healing to cure and possibly immediate intervention to avoid death. 


Taking Stress & Stress Tracks
A character takes Stress whenever they fail in an Attempt to avoid Harm, such as while defending against an attack, driving at high speeds, casting a spell and so on. Stress is tracked using three stress tracks; Physical, Mental and Spiritual. The Physical stress track deals with physical harm, the Mental Stress Track mitigates mental harm, and the Spiritual Stress Track addresses spiritual harm.  


All characters get 2 boxes in each track by default  with  the more boxes in a stress track the more resilient the character is against that type of Injury.  Certain Attribute Aspects increase or decrease the number of boxes a character has in specific stress tracks by adding or reducing the number of boxes by one for every 2 ranks above or below Average the Attribute is. 


* CON adjusts the Physical Stress Track.
* BER adjusts the Mental Stress Track.
* EVO adjusts Spiritual Stress Track. 


When they take stress, check off a number of stress boxes in the appropriate stress track equal to the value in the Stress column for the MoSF Stress table for the MoSF Rank.


Example :  Miko Farcheese ‘The Walker’ has an Average EVO giving him the default of 2  Stress Boxes in the Spiritual Stress Track, a Good  CON giving him 1 extra box in the Physical Stress Track for a total of 3 and a BER of Poor reducing his Mental Stress Track to just 1 box. 
Recovering From Stress


Since Stress represents non-permanent harm, recovery time is generally short, often being a matter of minutes to a few hours depending on how many Stress boxes the character has checked off. It is for the GM to determine the speed at which Stress Boxes are recovered, but the characters must be out of the stressing situation and somewhere relatively safe, ie not stressed, in order to recover Stress Boxes. More often that not it involves simply resting for a while, catching ones breath, collecting yourself and so on. Stress Boxes are recovered incrementally and, if whatever resting period the GM deems appropriate is interrupted ,the stress recovery halts, in which case the number of boxes recovered, if any, is for the GM to decide.

Injury  Tracks
Once a character runs out of Stress Boxes in a track, further Harm to them results in a Injury of that stress type. A Injury  is more severe than stress—it represents some form of lasting damage or setback that they accrue from the conflict. Unlike Stress, Injury  can’t be eliminated through simple rest, they are something that’s going to be a problem for your character after the conflict is over and will take significant intervention to remove if they can be removed at all.


 Like Stress, every character has three Injury  Tracks, but unlike Stress, Injury  comes in three levels of severity—mild, moderate, and severe with each track having a slot for the three severities. Each Injury  suffered must be recorder in its own slot and  preferably in the lowest level open slot the Injury  can be placed in. The severity of the Injury  is situational and up to the GM, Player, and logic to decide. As a general guide for a character the size of an elephant, being stuck with a foot long blade would be a Mild Injury  and recorded as such. The same injury for a character the size of a house cat would be a Severe Injury  to say the least and would be recorded in the Severe slot.


Some Injuries may be so sever that the GM decides it takes up multiple Injury  slots, possibly all within the same track or even crossing tracks. Even some mild Injuries may take up the mild slot of more than one of the tracks, such as in the case of a undead type attack that does all three types of harm. 


A Injury  written in a slot is treated as an Aspect that represents the lasting effect incurred from the attack that remains on your character sheet until they’ve recovered the Injury  slot. While it’s on your sheet, the Injury  is treated like any other Aspect, except because the slant on it is so negative, it’s far more likely to be used to your character’s detriment. Unlike stress, an Injury  slot may take a long time to recover after the conflict is over. Similar to stress, a characters Injury  track is effected by  an exceptionally high STR, CON or BER, each adding one mild Injury  box to it’s respective Injury track if it is Great or higher, one Moderate if it is Legendary or higher and one severe if it is Mythic.

Traumatic Experiences  
If a character is unable to recover from Stress for an extended period of time, say for days or weeks while abducted, they are considered to be having a Traumatic Experience and begin to suffer Stress Damage. A character suffering Stress Damage permanently loses one stress box at a time in the effected Stress Track until non are left. Once a character loses all boxes in a track further Stress Damage causes Traumas Damage to the character and continue to do so until the Traumatic Experience is over, or the characters is ‘Dead’. 


How long a character needs to go without recovering stress before it’s considered a Traumatic Experience and the speed at which a character suffering from Stress Damage loses boxes is left to the GM. When deciding, the GM should take a number of situation into consideration such as Attribute Ranks, Extraordinary Aspects, Vocational abilities, Skills, Techniques and so on.  In addition to the mechanics of the game, the GM should also heavily consider the characters Origin & Integration Stories and the life of the character so far in game play. 


Example: Corg the Pilot’s ship lost its drive, multiple systems are failing, and he has been floating in space for four weeks with no rest, little sleep, and dwindling supplies. Since he is an experienced pilot from a spacer family who started him flying at 6 and was born in space the GM decided for him the situation just now reached the Traumatic Experience level for him, causing him to lose one Mental Track Box due to the constant mental Stress. However for his Earther first year co-pilot, who joined the Space Force to “get away from the farm” ,the Traumatic Experience started after week one and has left him with no remaining Mental Stress tracks, two less Physical Boxes, and a single Spiritual Stress Box, 5 boxes in all.




Prolonged Hostage Situation
* Character Background: Lara, a seasoned diplomat, is taken hostage during a political uprising.
* Traumatic Experience: Lara endures psychological and minor physical abuse over three weeks of captivity.
* Stress Damage: Given her background in high-stakes diplomacy, the GM decides the trauma starts affecting her after two weeks. She loses two Mental Stress boxes due to constant fear and anxiety, and one Physical Stress box due to restrained movement and minor injuries.
* Recovery: Once rescued, Lara undergoes extensive therapy and rehabilitation. Her Mental Stress boxes are slowly recovered over several months, but she retains a lasting Mild Mental Injury (Anxiety) in her Injury Track. Her Physical Stress box is regained after a few weeks of physical therapy.
Stranded in Wilderness
* Character Background: Markus, a city-born adventurer, finds himself stranded in a dense forest.
* Traumatic Experience: Isolated and struggling to survive, Markus faces starvation, exposure, and the psychological toll of solitude.
* Stress Damage: For Markus, unaccustomed to extreme wilderness survival, the experience becomes traumatic after one week. He loses all his Spiritual Stress boxes, reflecting a crisis of faith and purpose, and two Mental Stress boxes due to the intense isolation and fear.
* Recovery: Rescue brings immediate physical relief, but Markus's Spiritual Stress boxes are permanently lost, signifying a deep existential crisis that he struggles with long-term. His Mental Stress boxes are partially recovered through counseling, but he gains a Moderate Mental Injury (Depression) in his Injury Track.
Continuous Battlefront Service
* Character Background: Elena, a combat medic, is deployed in a war zone without relief.
* Traumatic Experience: Continuous exposure to combat, injuries, and death over several months.
* Stress Damage: As a seasoned medic, Elena withstands the initial weeks, but after two months, the constant stress takes its toll. She loses all her Mental Stress boxes due to the relentless nature of her duties, and three Physical Stress boxes because of fatigue and minor injuries.
* Recovery: Post-deployment, Elena's Physical Stress boxes are gradually restored through rest and medical care. However, her Mental Stress boxes are not fully recoverable. She remains with reduced Mental Stress capacity and adds a Severe Mental Injury (PTSD) to her Injury Track. Ongoing psychological support helps her manage the trauma.
Magic Overuse in a Forbidden Ritual
* Character Background: Rowan, an ambitious mage dabbling in arcane rituals.
* Traumatic Experience: Rowan engages in a forbidden ritual that extends for days, tapping into dark magic beyond his control.
* Stress Damage: The intense concentration and spiritual corruption of the dark magic begin affecting Rowan after the first 48 hours. He loses all his Spiritual Stress boxes, signifying a profound spiritual disturbance, and two Mental Stress boxes due to the mental strain of controlling the magic.
* Recovery: Following the ritual, Rowan's Spiritual Stress boxes are permanently lost, indicating a lasting spiritual scar and a shift in his magical alignment. His Mental Stress boxes recover slowly with the help of a mentor, but he acquires a Moderate Spiritual Injury (Taint of Dark Magic) in his Injury Track, influencing his future spellcasting and interactions with other magical beings.
Prolonged Isolation in Deep Space
* Character Background: Zara, a deep-space explorer on a solo mission.
* Traumatic Experience: Zara's spacecraft becomes stranded in an uncharted region of space, cutting off all communication with her base.
* Stress Damage: Accustomed to solitude in space but not to complete isolation, Zara begins to experience trauma after three weeks. She loses all her Mental Stress boxes due to the psychological impact of isolation and uncertainty about rescue, and one Physical Stress box as her physical condition deteriorates with limited resources.
* Recovery: Once rescued, Zara undergoes a lengthy rehabilitation process. Her Physical Stress box is regained with proper care and nutrition, but her Mental Stress capacity remains diminished. She adds a Mild Mental Injury (Agoraphobia) to her Injury Track, reflecting her newfound fear of open spaces and desire to stay in familiar, enclosed environments.
Surviving a Haunted House
* Character Background: Mia, an amateur paranormal investigator.
* Traumatic Experience: Mia spends several nights in a notoriously haunted house, experiencing disturbing supernatural phenomena.
* Stress Damage: Despite her interest in the paranormal, the intensity of the hauntings quickly overwhelms her. After just three nights, Mia loses two Spiritual Stress boxes due to the spiritual terror and one Mental Stress box as her grip on reality wavers.
* Recovery: Post-experience, Mia is deeply shaken. While her Mental Stress box is partially recoverable through therapy, her Spiritual Stress boxes remain lost, representing a lasting impact on her spiritual well-being. She gains a Mild Spiritual Injury (Haunted Memories) on her Injury Track, causing sporadic flashbacks and discomfort in situations reminiscent of the haunting.


Crash-Landed on an Alien Planet
* Character Background: Dr. Lena Voss, a renowned xenobiologist on an expedition to study alien flora and fauna.
* Traumatic Experience: Dr. Voss's exploration vehicle crash-lands on an unexplored, hostile alien planet, leaving her stranded and injured.
* Stress Damage for Dr. Voss: With her extensive training and experience in off-world expeditions, Dr. Voss manages to stay relatively composed for the first few days. However, the ongoing threat of alien predators and the struggle for survival in a harsh environment begin to take their toll. After one week, she loses two Physical Stress boxes due to injuries and fatigue, and one Mental Stress box due to the constant vigilance and fear.
* Recovery for Dr. Voss: Once rescued, Dr. Voss undergoes physical rehabilitation for her injuries, regaining her Physical Stress boxes. However, the psychological impact of her ordeal leaves her with a permanent reduction in her Mental Stress capacity. She adds a Mild Mental Injury (Nightmares of Alien Predators) to her Injury Track, reflecting the traumatic memories of her close encounters on the alien planet.
* Stress Damage for Assistant Kyle: Kyle, Dr. Voss's assistant, is a young academic on his first field mission. The trauma of the crash and subsequent dangers of the alien planet overwhelm him much sooner. By the end of the first week, he loses all his Mental Stress boxes, overwhelmed by the terror and uncertainty. Additionally, he loses two Physical Stress boxes due to lesser physical resilience and inadequate survival skills. His Spiritual Stress box remains intact, supported by his strong belief in the mission's scientific value.
* Recovery for Assistant Kyle: After the rescue, Kyle's physical injuries heal, and he regains his Physical Stress boxes. However, the mental trauma of the experience is more enduring. He suffers a permanent decrease in his Mental Stress capacity and gains a Moderate Mental Injury (Acute Anxiety Disorder) on his Injury Track, affecting his ability to partake in future field missions.






Taken Out & Death
If they don’t have any stress or traumas left to buy off all the Ranks of a ‘hit’, they’re taken out. Taken out is bad, really, really bad - it means not only can they not fight anymore, they can’t take any attempts at all, other than laying on the ground and ‘bleeding out’. Whether it involves the actual loss of  blood, mentally ‘breaking’ or spiritually ’fading’ depends on the type of damage taken, and a character could possibly be doing all three at the same time.  A character that has been taken out needs immediate aid or they will ‘die’ in a very short amount of time. The exact definition of  ‘immediate’ is left to the GM, who should consider the environment, the type of injuries sustained, any first aid that is being administered (or not) and so on.
Types of Death
Physical 
 Fairly straight forward, they are dead in the classical sense of the word, simply put, the characters body ceases to function at all.
Mental 
 The character is effectively brain dead, whether they are in a vegetative state or are so mentally broken they are incapable of any attempt other than huddling in a corner whimpering depends on what the GM decides. Either way the character  is incapable of any meaningful actions, including feeding themselves, walking, talking or anything else a ‘normal’ character can do.
Spiritual 
The character's very soul or spirit is destroyed, they are fully functional in the physical and mental sense but they are no longer ‘themselves’. The end result is that the character becomes an NPC, no longer controlled by the player but rather is now ’owned’ by the GM. In games where Spiritual death can occur there are usually ‘things’ that are more than happy to possess such a hollow vessel, which may or may not look kindly upon the character’s previous companions.














Skill Domain Cost










ATTEMPT SYSTEM 
        Any time a character attempts to do something the  
attempt system is used to determine the outcome.  Every  
attempt will fall into one of three categories: Attack attempt, Magic attempt or feat attempt. 
 
Success Role (SR) 
        Any time a character makes an attempt,  a success  
Role is use to determine whether or not it succeeded. To  
determine the base SR role 1d100oe. The SR is then  
modified by Success Score Modifiers. 
 
Success Role Modifier(SRM) 
        Success Role Modifiers are any factors  
which would effect the outcome of an attempt. They 
are added (+SRM) or subtracted (-SRM) from the  SR.  
The most common SRM are listed under the attempt  
description in two columns, one column list the SRM that  are added to the SR and the other list those that 
are subtracted 
 from the SR. 
 
        Target Score(TS) 
   A target score represents the basic difficulty  
of an attempt. When making an attempt the characters 
end SR must be equal to or higher than the TS to succeed.  The TS for the attempt categories are listed in 
the  description of each category. 
 
 Result  Difference (RD) 
   This represents the degree of success or failure of any given attempt.  The RD is used differently for each 
attempt category. The RD equals the difference between the SR and the TS.  
 
 
ATTACK ATTEMPTS 
TS 
The target score for an attack attempt is the  
defenders DFR. 
 
RD 
        The RD for an attack attempt is used to determine 
the amount of extra damage any given attack caused do to 
the location of the hit and skill of the attacker. The extra  
damage done is called the Success Damage Level  
(SDL) and if found by dividing the RD by 3. 
 
Ram 
Success 
        If a ram attack is successful the attacker has  
knocked the defender down.  The target takes an amount 
of damage equal to the attackers WDL plus the SDL. At this 
point both characters must regain their bearings at an AP 
cost equal top the attack's DL divided by fifteen.  The  
characters effected by the ram can not act at all (including  
active defences) until they regain their bearings.  
 
Failure 
        If a ram attack fails the attacker is susceptible to a 
counter attack by its intended victum.  The defender 
of the ram attack may attempt to throw the attacker at NO 
AP COST. The defender gets to use the  RD of the failed 
ram attack as a +SRM. 
        +                                -

Pin 
Success 
        If a pin attack is successful the defender can not 
act except to cast personal spells until it can Break Loose from 
the attackers pin.         The defender will take an amount of 
damage equal to the attackers WD until it breaks free.  The  
attacker can not act except to cast personal spells or release  
the defender. Neither characters can use active defences  
while engaged in a pin. 
 
Failure  
        If a pin attack fails the attacker is susceptible to a 
counter attack by its intended victum.  The defender 
of the pin attack may attempt to pin the attacker at NO 
AP COST. The defender gets to use the  RD of the failed 
pin attack as a +SRM.

Attempt Roll Modifiers (ARMs) 
Crunchy+
There are an infinite number of things that effect the difficulty of an Attempt Roll that is rolled into the Difficulty Rank in the Soft Rules that can be separated out for more crunch. These are called Attempt Roll Modifiers and are added to the Attempt Roll Score based on specifics of the particular attemt. There are three categories of ARM that the GM should consider when deciding on what modifiers apply to an Attempt Roll; Environmental, Personal and Situational.
Environmental (wet, dark, cluttered, Quiet):  How does the area in which the attempt is being made affect the difficult. 
Personal (injured, tired, excited, hungry):  How does the personal condition of the Character making the attempt affect the difficulty. 
Situational (running, flying, bound):  How does the situation affect the difficulty. 
Stress Modifiers
Crunchy

        Long ago in ages past a great  Eternal Emperor ruled over a vast empire spanning billions of star systems and trillions of life forms. For untold ages his wisdom , compassion and  great intellect guided the Empire and it’s people through a time of  peace and prosperity; it’s technological, political  and scientific achievements unsurpassed by any other. But there came a time that they delved too deeply into the mysteries and dark corners of reality, unwittingly releasing the Elder Dark; a malevolent force so powerful and alien it was  beyond even their understanding.  When first beset by the foul creatures of the Elder Dark, the Darken, it seemed that perhaps the Imperial Forces would prevail and the Great Empire would stand against the Darken tide. But this was not to be, for soon came Gore, the Herald of the Elder Dark who slew the Eternal Emperor and cast the Empire into darkness and death. It’s people lost hope for with the Eternal Emperor gone there was no one to unify them and direct them in their battle against the forces of the Elder Dark. It seemed for a certainty that all was lost and the people would fall with their Empire. 
But there can not be darkness without light and the Elder Dark had enemies of it’s own. Enemies from a corner of reality even further and stranger than from where it hailed.  When all seemed lost there came the Wizards of Foe, the elite warriors of the mighty and mystical Foen race and the vanguard of their army. They did not fight the forces of the Elder Dark with Science and Technology, but rather with Magic and Mind; things the people of the Empire thought but myth and fantasy.  Though many of the Nobel Houses embraced the Wizards and their Arcane art, a number feared the power it placed in the hands of their subjects and shunned magic and the Wizards themselves. 
Those that did embrace the Wizards and the knowledge they brought in the end proved  to be in sufficient numbers. After many bloody battles the combined Imperial and Foen forces gained the upper hand and slowly turned the tides of war. The war continued to raged for untold generations, ravaging the empire and decimating the unity that had once bound the Empires  peoples. Many of the Great Noble Houses were utterly destroyed, their armies crushed and their bloodline lost forever. After over a thousand years of warfare, in a the last great battle of The Darken Wars the forces of the Elder Dark were finally broken and defeated. What was left of the Darken Hoard was pushed out of the Inner Territories where the majority of the Empires population resided and into the dark corners of the Outer Territories, a place no longer part of the Empire.  On that day the people of the once great Empire rejoiced, for they looked forward to the return of the peace and stability that the historians said once existed within the Empire.
 But as happens so often when a seat of great power is left vacant, those Noble Houses that were left could not agree to whom should sit the Imperial thrown. The wizards of Foe, themselves reduced in numbers and power  due to the war, receded back into the distant places  from which they came, leaving it to the Noble houses to decide the fate of the empire. Having known nothing but warfare for many generations, the Noble Houses found they lacked the diplomatic skills to resolve this issue by peaceful means and civil war ensued. 
However, again the Empire was saved from complete destruction by outside forces, this time in the form of immensely powerful beings who collectively called themselves Elder Gods.  The Elder Gods resided on planes of existence far removed from that of the mortals of the Empire and first noticed the Empire due to the shear amount of magical energies released during The Darken War. It did not take long for the most desperate and war weary of the Empires population to turn to them with Faith and Prayers, which the Elder Gods looked upon favorably and often answered with Miracles, both minor and major. Soon ‘The Temple’  formed around the worship of ‘The Divine Ones’, with all the requisite ceremony and bureaucracy and quickly gained a solid sway over the masses. 
While the coming of The Divine ones did indeed keep the Empire from it’s final death throes, it only slowed the bleeding and re-framed the civil war. While The Divine Ones were benevolent gods to those who sought their favor and gave them faith and worship, those who chose continue to rely on the Arcane Arts taught by the Wizards of Foe where soon labeled as Heretics.  For the Noble Houses who had shunned the Wizards and relied on technology during The Darken Wars this was of no real concern. But for those houses that had embraced the Wizards and their Arcane Arts, this was anathema to them as the Arcane Arts were now as integral to their functions as science. 
The split between the Nobel Houses who gave worship to The Divine Ones and those who did not became known as ‘The Great Divide’ and became the main focus of the civil war, the Imperial Throne now just a tool to be used for a higher goal. With this new focus of the combatants two distinct sides formed; those of ‘The Temple’  and those of  ‘The Council’.  
The Temple holds sway over the noble houses who worship The Divine Ones. By  indoctrinating their populations with the direct aid of The Divine Ones, The Temple eventually unified the ’faithful’ houses all under an Imperial Theocracy where ‘Divineism’ was the state mandated religion. 
The Council grew out of the need for the ‘Heretical Houses’, or the Old Empire as they called themselves, to coordinate their efforts in defending against the unified forces of The Temple.  The Houses of the Old Empire chose to mirror the former Emperors Imperial Council in the structure of their governing body, opting for a council  that consisted of at least one member of each Nobel House in the Old Empire. 
From their entrenched power bases the two sides battle across the tattered remnants of their once beloved Empire in a civil war that sees no near end. Vast fleets of starships ply the depths of space leaving a trail of debris and destruction in their wake. 
Great armies march the Planetary Conduits, pawns in and ever shifting front that spans thousands of systems which fall and are re-taken over and over again. The wielders of Magic and Mind  battle those who command Faith and Prayer, each  seeking scower the other from existence. 
The struggle for the soul of the Empire along with it’s throne still rages and the long forgotten remnants of the Elder Darks forces still hunt across the stars waiting for their to return. 
They are now  part of the war of the Fallen Empire..


Fallen Empire – The state of things
Territories
The Inner Territories
The once great Empire is in ruins,  it’s former territories are now either controlled by one of the remaining Noble Houses, are independent territories governed by a wide range of ruling bodies or have fallen into a state of lawlessness with no governing body beyond the force of arms. 


The Outer Territories
 Some of the more territories furthest from the Imperial Capital have been effectively lost by Empire. Being so distant from the former Imperial capital that the Noble Houses and Imperial forces in general no longer have any need or desire to exert any influence on them. Like wise, if anyone still exists out their, they appear to have no interest in the affairs of the Inner Territories. 




Noble Houses
There are 13 greater Noble Houses and any number of lesser Noble Houses, each with some degree of political influence and varying territory sizes. All Major Nobles of a house will be of one and only one race, but they often grant minor titles to their subjects of other races for vary reason;  showing exemplary service to their house in  battle, greatly advancing the houses technology, the need to have a region dominated by a non-house race by a member of the dominate race, etc.
 All Noble Houses maintain a military of some size to protect their territorial borders, expand said borders and further their Imperial goals through military means. 


These militaries tend to be the primary focus of a houses resources and before the coming of the Divine Ones, all Nobles were required to be military officers. Once the Divine ones made their presence known and the Theocracies were established to a sufficient degree this law was changed so that a Noble had the option of joining the military or the theocracy. A very small number of the houses, and mostly the minor houses at that chose not to garner the benefits of the ‘Divine Ones’ and turned to Archan Magic instead. In these houses Mageocracies were established and it is law that the Nobles join the military or the Mageocracies. 


Regardless of whether a Noble House has a Theocracy or a Mageocracy, the military almost always resents the reduction of influence, resources and manpower. This situation creates a great deal of inner-house intrigue, power struggling and at times open warfare amongst the contending establishments.






Technology
Technology In General
Technology varies widely from territory to territory, especially in lawless places as many of the advancements of the Empire have been forgotten or lost due to the wars. Those territories that remained under the control and protection of a Noble House tend to have retained much, though not all, of the advancements which existed during the age of the Empire.  In many of the places where The Temple holds sway it has become the common practice of the Noble Houses to allow only the use of basic technologies to the ‘commoners’ and retain the benefits of advanced technologies to themselves. 
Some societies have come to shun all but the most basic technologies, blaming it for the vast devastation throughout the former Empire. Others have turned to it whole-heartedly (usually only within the independent territories), investing all their efforts into advancing the technology that they have retained in the hopes that it will protect them from the ravages of the civil war. In these societies cybernetic implants, robotics and bio-engineering are the norm. Most societies however (the norm for Noble House territories) have a moderate level of technology where cybernetics, robotics, etc. are not the norm, nor are they rare, and are usually only employed by those that use them in the day-to-day situation such as Scientist, military officers, police, etc. 
Space Travel - Ships
Space travel is still a very common technology, though the levels and methods vary from dark matter drives to solid fuel engines. The most common advanced engines are hyper-drives as understanding of the science behind these drives have been retained by just about every House and many of the independent territories. Those that do not have ‘in-house’ understanding of the technology  often employ Star Children scientist to make up for their lack.
The most advanced ship engine currently known is the ‘Fold Drive’, which enables a ship to fold space, brining point A to point B and allowing a ship to instantly travers the distance between. The technology that drives these engines is extremely advanced and few if any Scientists can claim a true understanding of workings. As a result no new Fold Drives are produced within the Inner Territories (no one knows what is happening in the Outer Territories), as a result there are fewer and fewer ships capable of Fold Travel as the stockpiles of repair parts dwindle.  These drives are almost exclusively owned by one of the Noble houses, being reserved for military ships or the personal ships of powerful and influential Nobles.
Fold Roads
Perhaps one of the crowning achievements of Imperial technology, the Fold Roads were the ‘roads’ that connected the territories of the Empire and allowed it’s people and goods to travel from planet to planet without the need of space travel. These roads employ a similar technology to ship Fold Drives, though they are even more advanced and far more complex than Fold Drives. For one to travel from one end of a road to another is a simple matter of stepping onto the origin road and they are instantly transported to the destination road. There are a few laws that govern Fold Road travel that a wise traveler should be aware of.
The origin road and the destination road are the opposite ends of the same road, if either is destroyed, both are destroyed.
They can not travel from a destination road to an origin road , travel is only one way. Due to this almost all Fold Roads come in pairs, one for traveling to the destination and one for traveling back to the origin. 
A Fold Road can be moved from it’s original location to a different location without disrupting it’s normal functioning. This is however an extreme undertaking and requires vast resources to do so. It is also highly dangerous as without proper care and procedure a road in transit can become unstable resulting in a cataclysmic explosion large powerful enough to vaporize a medium sized planet. The Imperial engineers had the tools and methodologies to move them safely and many of the largest Imperial Galaxy Class cruisers carried both origin a destination roads but most of the ships and the technology are for the most part long lost.
The energy required to power a road is proportional to the distance between the origin road and the destination road. They draw their power from a Forcythum generator which is more often than not located close to the origin road. Depending on the amount of fuel stored in the generator they can operate for hundreds of years. During the Imperial age vast stores of Forcythium were kept in warehouses at the Conduit Stations, but those store houses are dwindling and many a modern road traveler has found themselves stranded when they discovered that the Origin roads on the planet to which they traveled are no longer powered. While Forsythium generators are the most common and efficient way to power a Fold Roads they are not the only way. Forcythians of sufficient power have the ability to naturally generate an energy field that is compatible with the roads. However depending on the distance between the Origin and the Destination road, coupled with the level of the Forcythian governs the successfulness of such an endeavor.






Imperial Races
While their were an untold number of races that lived within the territories of the once greate Galactic Empire, the bulk of it citizens hailed from a relative few species. Those races that survived the first war are known collectively as the Imperial Races and are the only ones left in sufficient numbers to have any hopes to claim the thrown.




Beastmorphics
More commonly known as Morhps,  Beastmorphics is a  collective term referring to a number of separate species that all share the common trait of possessing the ability to physically transform their bodies from a near human form to that of  a beast. Most Morphs are also able to assume ’semi-bestial’  state that is a perfect mixture of their human and beast affording them the advantages of both forms. There are a number of primary species, most of which also have a number of sub-species that come in a variety of types and cultures,  all of which whose origins are lost to the ravages of time. Some say that they are the result of experimental genetic engineering but others claim that they are naturally evolved. The fact that each species of Morphs claims a different planet as their place of origin lends more credence to the first theory than the second, but non can as of yet truly lay that question to rest. These conflicting claims are a point of violent contention between the different Morph species and is the cause of many Morph on Morph wars. The species of Morph that still rules the planet of origin would be able to claim that they are the purest of the truest of the Morph bloodlines and could call upon all the other Morphs to aid them in their claim to the Imperial Thrown. 


Tabbyons


A race of feline like humanoids they are as varied in form and nature as the great cats they seem to have originated from. While each sub-species has their own unique culture and governing bodies they are the most cooperative of all Morphs and it is not uncommon to find multiple sub-species of Tabbyons living and working together in relative harmony.
Species Traits 
Type: HumanoidSpecies:
Sub-Species:
Size: Medium - Large (see Sub-species)
Ability Modifiers: see Sub-species
Speed: see Sub-species
Special Abilities
 Alternate Form (EP - Con): All but the weakest of  Tabbyons have the ability to change their from their natural human like state into one of a bipedal great cat or a very large great cat.  
1.        Natural state – A human with Feline like features.
2.        Tabby – A bipedal great cat that walks upright, has opposable thumbs and retains the ability to speak and think as normal. In this form certain attributes will be enhanced depending on the Sub-Species.
3.        Great Feline – The form of a Lion, Panther or other great cat depending on the Sub-Species.
Blind Sight: Due to their acute sense of smell and hearing coupled with their ability to sense vibration through their whiskers Tabbyons have Blind Sight within 60’. Note that the vibrations and/or spores must be able to reach the tabbyons head, thus this ability is nullified in an environment where there is no atmosphere (such as if the Tabbyon is in a space suit while in space)
Low-Light Vision: Tabbyons have low-light vision. They can see normally in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of  shadowy illumination. They retain the ability to distinguish color and detail under these conditions.

A race of humanoids that are able to transform into a wear-Panther or full panther at will. They are ruled by a shadow organization known as 'Sintow' who are so secretive members do not know the other members and are not permitted to public declare membership. They are masters of all things deception, stealth and subterfuge, are highly intelligent, natural assassins and steeped in the magical arts of Shadows & Void from birth. Sintow are known for their 'Talon Dirks', the dark blades they fight with that can think for themselves and take the shape of any bladed weapon at will, usually right as it strikes to maximize damage. The Dirks and their natural abilities combined make them formidable opponents but they further augment their effectiveness with a specially woven rope that is sentient and capable of acting on its own, making them truly terrifying assassins of the highest caliber. Dark Tabbyons employ techno-magic in creating their devices, fusing the most advanced sciences and technological advances with the oldest and darkest of the Arcane Arts.




Troww
        A bipedal race of reptilians, they evolved on the planet Trowlin, a heavily watered world predominantly covered by swamps and bogs. Standing 9’ on average to an average earth person they would appear to be the perfect genetic mix of a great ape and a Black Mamba snake,  their massive bodies are covered in small blue black scales.  They have long whip like tails, stand on two feet and have very long claws on the tips of their 7 fingers which they sport on the ends of two massive arms. They have a powerful paralytic venom that they are able to inject into unfortunate victims via their very long, cuver fangs. They are physically powerful and lightning quick, their large bodies designed for striking speed backed by explosive power. They are not the most intelligent species in the galaxies, though they have an aptitude for reverse engineering military technology. This aptitude has allowed them to become the clear leader in military technology within the galaxy and the technology they captured from Gores forces during the war only furthered that lead.




Over thousands of years they have spread threw out the galaxy and control some of the largest kingdoms. They are without a doubt the commanders of the most powerful militaries of the Noble Houses and only the internal warfare which rages between the Trowwen houses prevents them from uniting and pushing aside all other contenders for the thrown.  Even with these troubles their ability to clearly prove that their bloodline is pure to the galaxy gives them a strong claim to the Imperial Thrown. 


        




Star Children (Humans)
        The humans in the the galaxie are collectivly refered to as the Star Children, wich is a refernce to their claim that they came from the stars. Infact no one knows the origins of humans  though Star Children legend says that their ancestors came from a far off place through a ‘portal’ on their own. The fact that they most widly scatterd of all the races makes this the most probable explanation. Due to this wide scattering they are they are the weekest of all the races with regard to galactic politics and influence. 


This was not always the case and infact the the last Emperor was a Star Child, which to all other races seemed  the best situation as they showed no favoritisim to any one race in particular. With their wide scattering, the Star Childrens presence in almost every system of the empire ensured that even if the Emperor showed a prefernce to his people, any boons he would give them would enevitably benefit all the systems in which they lived. But that of course was before the coming of Gore.


When it was discovered that Emperor had been possed it was also relized that the Star children were highly suseptable to the new menace of the Daemon, which imidiatly made all Star Children suspect. Things got even worse for the Star Children when Gore’s army was engaged, for the army was predominatly composed of Star Children. 


As things stand now Star Children are rarely welcomed on any planet and have been relegated to a second class citizen status. The general rule is that no Star Child may hold any official office nor do they have any Noble Houses of their own. Their one saving grace is that they are often employed as Scientist wich is due to their extream creativity and technological aptitude, a trait un-paralleled by any of the other races. For the most part the Star Children live a life beffiting of their name, traveling form system to system in colony ships, plying their technological advances and trying to avoid the ire of the other races.


Shogoto
        The Shogoto are an ethereal races of bipedal creatures and are often referred to as the People of the Mist. It is said that they evolved on a planet caught between twin stars on wich the winds constantly raged at incredible speeds. The loose molecular bonds of their bodies allow matter to pass through them while they are in an ethereal state, effectively rendering them immune to matter attacks. Even while they are not in an ethereal state they are resistant to matter attacks as even while they are in solid form, they molecules of their bodies are widely dispersed. 


        The Shogoto have no houses of their own and as such have no aspirations to sit one of their own on the Thrown. This is not to say that they are not in the thick of the conflict, for as in the war against Gore they employ their special properties to excell as spies and assasins. This is the predominate occupation of the Shogoto, so much that it has become the basis on which they have developed their culture. While, as stated earlier, they do not have houses, all Shogoto are a member of a clan. The clans are bloodline based and are rulled by a clan leader who controls the ‘bussiness’ dealings of the clan. 




Forychian
        Forychians are a quadrupedal, elemental based life form and as such are the masters of the star gates. Their unique physiology enables them to generate an energy field around them that they are able to employ in a number of ways, which includes the ability to power and activate a Planitary Road without the aid of any other power source or they need to visualize the destination road. They are also able to focus this energy field into a beem that can be used as an energy wepon or if they choose they can encrease the field around them to generate a force field.


The ability to generate this field put them in the forfront of the war against Gore, as it allowed them, and the forces with wich they were opperating near un-fetted access to any planet which had a Planitary Road. This ability was not the only thing that made them such a major participent in the war for Gore relized the vast potential of harnessing this inate ability. Un-counted numbers of Forychians perished in Gore’s experimental attempts to harness their power, but harnessing intelegent Forychium prove to be a task even beyond a Daemon and he was untlimitly unsuccessful. With the realization that he would never be successful in his attempts the Forychians became the focus of an extermination campaign in which fully 90% of the Forychians were slain. 


This event effected the Forychian psycology in a profound and lasting way and to date there is no greater honor for a Forychian than to kill a Daemon. It also resulted in a deep distrust and at times hatred of the Star Children as the prodominate force employed in the extermination campaign were the humans. The Forychians are obsessed with preventing another Daemon from gaining any mesure of power in the galaxie, or, for that matter, even living in the galaxie at all. To that goal all Forychians are required by cultural law to spend at least 50 years (they live for over 300 years)  as a member of a Hunter Sqaud, the sole purpose of wich is to travel from planet to planet rooting out and destroying any Daemon or Daemon agents. 


Along with the advantages that their Forcythium base provides them it also inflicts upon them a major disadvantages as well. This diasadvantage can be most devestating to them (and anyone around them) as they are highly suseptable to energy weapons. While they are able to focus their energy field in into a force field, should the be stuck by any energy burst of sufficient power while they are unprotected (or the force field is over come) they are apdt to exploded in a most spectacular way. 


Race Set #2


Troww - A bipedal race of reptilians, they evolved on the planet Trowlin, a heavily watered world predominantly covered by swamps and bogs. Standing 9’ on average, to an earth person they would appear to be the perfect genetic mix of a great ape and a Black Mamba snake. Their massive, sleek bodies are covered in small blue black scales and is supported and propelled by two equally large legs. They have two arms that are directed forward that end in hands with opposable thumbs and seven finger tipped with very long retractable claws. They have 3 long whip like tails that end in rattles and sport a powerful paralytic venom that they are able to inject into unfortunate victims via long, curved fangs. They are physically powerful and lightning quick with large bodies designed for striking speed backed by explosive power. They are not the most intelligent species in the galaxy, but they have an aptitude for reverse engineering military technology which they employ to utmost effectiveness.


Dark Tabbyon - 




Valaskin -  The Valaskins are the decedents of a Viking raiding party that were lost in a storm at sea. When they finally managed to find land and beach their boat they stumbled into the middle of a pack of daemons on their way to a near by Inuit village to finish their work of the night before, which was killing everyone in the village. The Vikings set upon the daemons immediately, fighting with such abandonment, furry and wanton blood lust legends say the daemons fled in terror. When the Warrior Priest who traveled with the Vikings learned of the daemons true intent, he declared the Inuits 'The Blessed Innocent' for why else would the devil want them all dead, He then decreed that the Vikings would found their own village on the shore where they landed to defend the Inuits, those chosen by God. The many ages of battling daemons side by side and being exposed to the powers of Damnation and Salvation, generation over generation, changed both peoples, seeing them merge into one and changing the very nature of their being. They are now a human people of dark skin, blue eyes, blond hair, slightly flattened but square facial features who stand on average seven feet tall for both men and woman. The Women are full figured, voluptuous and generally highly attractive as well as the primary fighting force of the Valaskin military. The most formidable of which carry on the Viking tradition of Berserk , but adding a mystical element of their own by spewing raw mystic power from eye's and mouth in whipping cords during combat which utterly annihilates almost anything they touch. When entering combat Valaskin woman wear a full set of armor called 'The Binding' that encases them from head to toe. The Binding is highly runed and is meant to protect the wearer not only form physical blows but mental and spiritual ones as well, not least of all daemon possession. (There are men but I want a woman in these)


Exoliens - A Gold based life form, they appear as small gender less humanoids with four feathered wings and polished gold skin. They have a prismatic face that reflects light causing the viewer to see themselves in it trapped within an 'endless tunnel' illusion. They are highly intelligent, technologically and magically advanced, and can naturally communicate on any wave length as well as telepathically. They prefer not to enter physical combat, always employing their magical abilities first, followed by their technology to deal with situations from afar. Both their magic and technology, like themselves, tend to be highly polished and flashy, but also extremely capable and effective. They are master diplomats and often see problems coming long before they arrive; taking actions to prevent them from arriving to start with. While they avoid hand to hand combat when possible they are lethal close quarter opponents to say the least, employing their razor sharp feathers to eviscerate their opponents or, as they are the same weight as gold, simply smash their appendages into bones and flesh alike. To further challenge wood-be opponents Exoliens only dent when stuck with sufficient force, which is a significant amount, losing no capabilities to injury what so ever. They are a rare race, only known to number in the low tens of thousands through out the know universe but in truth no one knows of their origin or home world and no Exolien will tell and non-Exolien so how many there are is anyone's guess. It is also thought they are immortal though that to is unconfirmed.

Each player who is creating a new character rolls 1d6 to determine the order the GM will pick players in to detail their characters Moniker, Ancestral Name and  Epithet (one at time, chosen by the GM)  out loud to the GM and the rest of the players.  When it is a players turn, they roll on the appropriate table a number of times equal to the result the dice roll as indicated in the tables header. They then use the result (s) as the basis of the story for whatever it is they are tasked with detailing. 


 




Play Methods


GMs’ World
The traditional way of play an RPG, the GM is the ‘Owner’ of the game, and controls anything that is not a PC including what happens when a PC succeeds or fails in as task.


Winners’ History
The same as GMs’ world except  on any Attempt roll, ie to hit, picking a lock, casting a spell, etc. if the player is 'successful' they get to decide the  outcome of the attempt, if not, the GM gets to decide. How much the player or GM gets to 'control' the story is based on the MoSF. For example a PC is attacking a monster, the player & GM both make their attempt rolls, the PC to Harm the monster and the GM for the monsters to avoid the Harm. The PC wins by 20 points, which is 2 Ranks in the system and the player gets to decide what the Harm does to the monster to the tune of 2 Ranks, be that damage, distracting it so the PC can escape, etc. 


Player Choice
Same as Winners History but  instead of the winner deciding the outcome they choose any player or the GM to decide the outcome




Party of Masters
There isn’t a single Game Master, instead different players are the Masters of different aspects of the game and are responsible for deciding the outcome of any Attempt within their domain. 
World Master - This Master is in control of the over all story and the campaign setting as along as it is not owned by another Master. 
Combat Master - This Master decides the results of any Attempt that is made during combat and is not owned by other Master.
Ex-Ord Master - This player decides the results of any Attempt that is made regarding the use of an Extraordinary Aspect.
